      <h1>Reptile Man II: Hunt of The Talismans</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
      Garry’s plan was to lead the perpetrators to a location that would be the battleground. There, they would meet them with allies. So, Garry, Jake, and Ino were at a football field, it was nighttime. Jill, and her sister, Mal called friends for help, a lot of them had experienced the Toad’s curses, which were lifted, but the memory lingered on, they were determined not to let Earth fall into evil hands.  Troy was there, he had a crossbow. Alex wielded his sword, and so did Brian. Makaio, a guy with a japanese sword, and Michael with and an axe. There was Ryan, a teenager with red hair, his battle weapons were two staffs that emitted shockwaves. I don’t know where he got it. Trevor, and Brandon, were there, and no I still do not know where they acquired their armaments. The powerhouse robot took them by surprise, but this time they were ready.
      <p>There was the roar of an engine, Gost, the robot, and Skull Baron leaped out of an aircraft. Skull Baron took out his gun, it was shot out of his hand by Garry’s arrow. The laser arrow shot the gun right out of Skull Baron’s hand. Gost clenched the amphibian talisman and transformed into the amphibian creature with the snake like arms. “How?” Jake said. He used his own talisman and turned into Reptile Man. Both he and Ino took on Gost. Garry and Michael took on Skull Baron and Makaio, Ryan, Troy, Brian, Alex, Trevor, and Brandon charged at the robot. Gost shot acid blasts. Ino quickly generated a red energy shield, this blocked the acid, he then fired  an energy laser. Jake shot a beam, Gost was pushed several feet. Meanwhile, Garry and Michael Harrison were doing awful good against Skull Baron, however, Troy, Ryan, Trevor, Ino, Brandon and Makaio  were having difficulties against the robot. “You don’t stand a chance, give up!” The robot shouted. Troy continued his crossbow assault with laser arrows from Garry, Makaio was swinging his ninja blade at the machine whenever he had the chance, there were a lot of chances since Ryan was using the shockwave staffs to hold back the robot. Trevor was trying to pull the robot to the ground with his gravity generator, Brandon was shooting energy beams constantly trying to breech the machine’s armor, but they were not having much success. There was no doubt that out of the three perpetrators, the robot was the toughest to defeat. The only part of the battle that did not show any sides winning was against Gost, so far anyway.  Jake and Ino both clawed Gost, Jake turned invisible and appeared on top of Gost’s back. Gost tried to get him of but Jake’s grip was too good. Jake charged a beam, Gost continued to struggle. Jake opened his crocodile mouth and let the energy loose. The flare lit up the field. Gost was on the ground, in human form.</p>
      <p>Gost was down, and Skull Baron was overcome. The robot was the only of the three standing and was still not defeated. Jake, Ino, Garry, and Michael joined the others against the machine. All of you challenge me now? Excellent! I shall take this to the Nightmare World!” He said. “Not again.” Jake said. “Not that!” Ino cried. “Welcome to the World of Nightmares!” The robot said as the dark steam came out of the two holes in his shoulders. “Don’t open the gate! Something will be unleashed, I can sense it!” Ino shouted. “Don’t be ridiculous! I control that realm now, I am the master! I am the only great power from it!” The robot laughed. Behind him, a dark gate was opening to the Nightmare World. Suddenly, two red eyes appeared in the gate, everybody stared. The robot stopped laughing. “What are you staring at? You are supposed to be horrified by me!” He decided to turn around. “What in the world?” He shouted. The eyes vanished, and a thirty-foot shadow came out of the gate, the shadow went into the ground, and came up six feet high. The shadows disappeared, and a creature like Ino stood in its place. “I was afraid of this.” Ino said. “Who is it?” Brian asked. “My brother, the one who attacked me with the Aqua Talisman. Inoik.” Ino said.</p>
