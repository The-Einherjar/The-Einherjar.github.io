      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 21</h2>
  The forces of Trulor arrived at the gates of Luris Coldor. “General Monstrost, you will stay here and command outside. Reqror, you and I will go in the city.” Zror said.
     <p>They couldn’t make it before Zror, the city was under siege. However, the rest of the Four Schools creatures caught up. “I have an idea.” Jake said.</p>
      <p>The gates broke, Zror, Reqror, and creatures entered. Suddenly, a detonation flared from a hill South of the capital, the left to the Trulor host. A glowing orange iron sphere skyrocketed through the air, the projectile crashed to the ground, it ignited, a burst of fire erupted. General Monstrost sighted Ryan, Jake, Brandon, and Trevor in the distance. He laughed an evil laugh. He then sent the big mounted creatures to attack.</p>
      <p>“It’s working!” Brandon exclaimed. Cannons framed to chariots bombarded the Trulor force. They were trying to separate the enemy. Jake signaled, flying creatures that looked like dragons flew. They each had two catapults mounted on their shoulders; a couple creatures operated the catapults. They fired the catapults at the main Trulor army. Archers fired at the incoming cavalry. Jasoner went to help the people inside Luris Coldor. “Zror is in there; perhaps I could distract him away from attacking other people long enough for you to arrive, then we could both take him. It won’t be easy, but I’ll try.” He said. Ryan shot a fireball at the incoming creatures. The two forces collided, one creature charged at Inoiker, who stood his ground, sword at the ready. He blocked the axe. Trevor’s sword glowed orange, he swung it, and a blade shaped Vlfirpotence blast hit a reptile boar rider, knocking him off the boar.</p>
      <p>“Send the Frerits.” The general ordered. Zror’s flying creatures flew toward the army of the Four Schools.</p>
      <p>A hundred flying chariots intercepted the Frerits, they were also shot down by arrows. Inoiker was fighting three boar riders at once. Two were shot by both Paulius and Chris, who had bows. Inoiker slashed the third. A reptile boar charged at a chariot, but fell to the ground; a charioteer had thrown a spear at it. Its rider swung its axe at a hawk creature, but the Herky struck first with a spear. Herkys had arms.</p>
      <p>“Vederk…” Zror said. An armored man with a long sword stood in front of the emperor, the battle raging around them. The two quickly clashed with swords. “You caused a lot of trouble to the sorcerer’s empire.” Zror said, swinging his sword. Verderk blocked.</p>
      <p>“Send the Elite Cavalry!” General Monstrost shouted. The dark clad riders charged.</p>
      <p>Jake was knocked down. Four mounted creatures were above him, Brandon shot thistles at them. “Thanks.” Jake said. Herkys rushed passed them and attacked attacking Frerits, Jake got up. “Pikes!” He directed. Creatures of the four schools with pikes got into position to intercept the Elite Cavalry. Archers shot arrows. Jake shot plasma energy, and  Brandon shot thistles. Most of the Elite Cavalry were able to evade the pikes. They attacked. One fell of its mount and attacked Jake. Jake blocked, and then shot a Vlfirpotence blast from his sword; the rider fell to the ground.</p>
      <p>“Send the Elites of Zror.” General Monstrost ordered. “What?” A commander asked. “Send them, now!” The general shouted. “They are inside the city.” The commander said. “The ones that are guarding the girls, then.” The general said. “You lost your command of the Elites of Zror. If the emperor finds out-” The commander was interrupted. “Now!” The general ordered.</p>
      <p>“Jake!” Trevor called, he pointed to the next group of soldiers charging, the Elites of Zror.</p>
      <p>“What happened?” Cristine asked. “I think our guards are gone.” Jaclyn answered.</p>
