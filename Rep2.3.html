      <h1>Reptile Man II: Hunt of the Talismans</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
      The fog cleared. "This is just what I feared." Ino said. "What?" Brian asked. "Many centuries ago the four talismans were created in India. Many evil people tried to get them but failed. The talismans were put in charge by my father Inoclamp. He had two sons, me and my brother Inex who was human. Inoclamp our father taught us all about the power of the talismans and trained us to become the talisman guardians when he was gone.  This continued until we were seventeen years old That is when he died. We both became the talisman guardians. That was when a problem came, we had a sister named Unibete, she had a different view of the talismans. She knew that one who owned all four of them can unleash  a powerful force that can dominate the entire world. She tried to take the talismans but failed. I hid three of them and Inex took flight with the Reptile Talisman, because of our sister’s threats. He took the Reptile Talisman with him. My sister started to spread the desire to own all four talismans to other people. I trained and armed many of my servants to get ready for a war. My sister gathered underlings and armed them as well. I was not about to battle this rebellion., Nonetheless, in order to keep the Talismans from being taken by the rebels, I had to keep alert. The rest of the city feared that there would be violence on their property, so they protested to the emperor of India. He sent his army to the city to try to enforce and keep a war from occurring. The rebels led by my sister kept on training and sent threats to the Emperor's army to stand down. They even wrote war signs on walls. I built a wall around my lair and built more towers, and turned it into a war fortress  and I doubled the training hours of my servants. The emperor's army still stayed. .One night the rebels decided to destroy me for once and for all. That was when Strangers from distant land called Zat came. There was a dark dread lord called Growun. The rebels joined him. This new rebellion was too much for my  force, however, there was another side with a leader called Gibbons the one were who originally trapped Grutwaq. They  joined my  side, and I joined theirs. Growun was annoyed by the emperor's army and sent his army to destroy them, we were too late to save them. Now people in the city were really scared. Many of them decided to leave. Some protested and armed themselves, they entered my fortress as militia.  My sister and Growun led their forces to destroy my fortress. I could still remember much of that battle. It lasted for three days straight.  My sister was barely alive and Growun was almost destroyed but he used the Fire Talisman and went away somewhere in the west. So, I only had track of two talismans. Sure, the rebels were beaten but I had a brother I sensed a great evil approaching, I had no idea my brother, who my sister influenced, would have been the evil."
      <p>"Why do we have to waste our time protecting those two talismans!?  Why do we obey an old clown of an emperor, when we can rule him with those two talismans? I know even two talismans could be quite devastating."  Inoik contended. He picked up the Aqua Talisman. "Inoik put that back." Ino ordered. "Or what? They are our talismans. Inex has a talisman, Growun has a talisman, why shouldn't I?" Inoik grinned. “Brother, we have been entrusted with protecting mankind before this earth was created. “ Ino uttered.  Inoik clenched the talisman and shot a shard of frozen ice. Ino dodged and grabbed the Plant Talisman and transformed into a talisman beast. He had a body that was a tree trunk. He also had six arms of thorn vines and roots that  are strong enough to keep him up without tripping over no matter what he also had some cactus thistles and two stinging leaves and a head with a horn on top of it. Inoik clenched his talisman again and became a talisman creature also this creature was capable of floating in midair and had a body of a great white shark and had a moray eel head and had lobster arms and whale fins and had a horn shark dorsal fin with the spine on it and he had a sword fish horn on his head "Inoik, this does not have to happen." Ino plead. "Enough!" Inoik yelled hitting Ino with a lobster claw. Ino was forced to the wall. "I don't wish to battle you my brother, but I  must!" Ino said as he swiped his thorn at Inoik's head. Inoik shot an ice blast at Ino. Ino shot a light beam from his mouth. The ice melted right before it hit him. Inoik stabbed Ino, but the horn was unable to go through the hard bark. Now Inoik was mad. He roared and glowed. "Bye brother, nice knowing you, but after this a new power will arise and the world will bow to me!" He said. white and blue energy from all around went inside Inoik. "So, you decided to use your talisman's secret power? Each Talisman has one." Ino said. He started to glow as well. He was using his talisman's secret power, green and yellow light surrounded him. Inoik fired a blue and white fire ball, but Ino was quicker, he shot a green ray of light with yellow lighting surrounding it. This hit Inoik before the fireball erupted out. Inoik hit the ground and changed back. The Aqua Talisman dropped on the ground. Ino changed back. "I am sorry, but according to my father's instructions, I must banish any family member who assaults freedom with a talisman to the Nightmare World. Good Bye." Ino took a spear from a locked chest and shot black lightning from it. "You may have sent me to that Nightmare World, but I will be back!" Inoik said before he vanished in a wall of flames.</p>
      "That was the day I hid the two remaining talismans that were in my grasp to two different locations." Ino finished. "Wow, you got quite the story have you ever thought of movie making?" Jake asked. "Good idea, but not right now we have a crisis going on a big one."  Ino said. "I think Garry has a plan." Jill said. "Yes, I do " Garry said.
