    <h1>Reptile Man IV: The Flames of Rorzron</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
      There was a district wide beach party, though only a hundred came. “Who thought of this?” Trevor asked. “Gost, he decided to have this to celebrate the two victories.” Brandon said. “What two victories?” Troy asked. “The victory over a Zorraider at Lynnwood, and the siege of Mountlake Terrace that happened at the same time.” Cody answered. “Terrace was besieged? I can’t remember that.” Troy said. “Remember that army Xroyadrick sent? Gost told you, Ryan, and Jill remember?” Jake asked. “Oh yes, I remember now. I’m tired.” Troy said.. “It’s not over. Zron has an army to unleash.” Gost said walking by. “Why did we have this party today?” Trevor asked. Suddenly, the clouds over in the Olympic Mountains turned red and lightning flashed from them. A red energy ball appeared and moved slowly towards the beach as if it was following something. “Zron has sent his forces to attack and his armies seem to be headed for Lynnwood high, as a teacher of Lynnwood, I officially call for defensive aid. In order to repel this force we must join forces.” Gost said. Jake looked at the energy ball moving closer and said. “Mountlake Terrace will join ” Jake said. David nodded in agreement. “Meadowdale will do the same thing.” Danny said. “Edmonds Woodway will not be left out.” Richard said. “This is why we are at the beach today, to link the four schools in a coalition.” Gost responded to Trevor. “An “Alliance of Four Schools?” Jake uttered. “Indeed. Now, we need to make a plan.” Gost said. 
      <p>It was noon of the third day, and all the allies that can be found were at Lynnwood. Zron’s army was crossing Puget Sound. Jake looked at the combined forces. “Six hundred thousand, a lot more then I expected.” He said. “The new recruits will need some training, however.” Ryan said. “Yes, a lot of training.” Trevor added. "We will, too." Brandon said.</p> 
        
        <p>Training took them three days and it was hard work, believe me. Zron’s armies were now in the city of Edmonds, but noticed by the military because of a curse Mons Surprem made. Spies of Lynnwood however, were able to see them. The spies reported back to Lynnwood, where the others were making the war plan. “What is your report?” Jill asked. “They have Shadowlings, Firelings, The Fire, and other strange creatures including, two Stouses . The spy said. “How many?” Jake asked. “Seven hundred thousand.” The spy replied. “Just a one hundred thousand difference.” Brandon stated. “We have traps set in.” Jake said. “How are we going to lure them in though? Their target is this school.” Troy said. “That is why we shall use the Multi Mirrors.” Jake said. “Multi what?” Ryan asked. “Mountlake Terrace forces have been building them. They are used to scare enemies. We will place creatures in four different stations: one in Lynnwood High, if this building is reached and besieged, it will need some defense. Two, in the football fields outside, an extra layer of school defense. Three, in front of the school, facing the hill. That is where Zron’s army shall attack from, we will then use Multi Mirrors from several of Cody’s flying chariots and our forces will look multiplied. They will not be, but the mirrors will create the illusions. The commanders of Zron’s army will see another route that leads through the mall. They will decide to go that route to make it quicker and easier then fighting a lot of enemies. Four, will be in Alderwood Mall, hiding and there will be tons of traps for Zron’s forces. Then, the creatures stationed there will attack and lower the enemy numbers, then we finish them off.” Jake said. “That sounds good.” Cody said. “Very well, we’ll do that.” Gost said. The forces of Rorzron were only one day from reaching Lynnwood.</p>
