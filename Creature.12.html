      <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
   Grutwaq inspected his army, it was ready. “The time has come! General Grutex, I want you to invade.” Grutwaq ordered. General Grutex was fifteen feet tall, had steel armor and a long  rapier. The army of Grutwaq  marched south to Lynnwood to attack the Gibbons house. “I have failed the last time, but this time, my armies shall destroy my enemies and capture the Gibbons so I can get my revenge on them, without interference.” Grutwaq’s evil laugh echoed through the storm.
    <p>“General Inospark, is everybody ready?” Ryan asked. “Almost, we are now loading the catapults.” The Inster said.  Jake was gathering the army from Mountlake Terrace, Brandon was gathering the forces from Edmonds, Trevor was helping Danny gather the army at Meadowdale, and Ryan was gathering the forces from Lynnwood.</p>
    <p>It was foggy. They were ready when a stone hit the defensive wall they rebuilt at the Gibbon’s house. There were creatures hiding in the storm drains and at Lynnwood High School, waiting.  Sure enough, they could see Grutwaq’s minions moving towards the wall. “Fire!” Ryan cried out. Volleys of arrows fired from the top of the wall at Grutwaq’s minions. The Second Battle of Maple Road had begun.</p>
