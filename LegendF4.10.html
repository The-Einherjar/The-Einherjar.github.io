      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
     The giants were mostly beaten, now the main enemy army moved forward. Archers aimed. “Fire!” Cody ordered, the first lines of Zror’s legions were hit. “Advance!” Jordan directed. The rest of the army pressed forward, except for the ones guarding the trebuchets. They collided with the army of Zror. Cody fought with a sword and spear, Jordan had dragon heads on his arms, wings, and a dragon tail, he used a spear as well. The fusion of Trevor and Brandon shot ice, and then hit with the trunk. “I like that tactic.” They said.
     <p>They continued. “We’re close.” Mr. Gibbons said. They were fifteen minutes away. Mrs. Gibbons was on the phone. ”They engaged Zror’s forces, at Alderwood.” She confirmed.</p>
    <p>A giant with wings dived towards Jake, Trevor, and Brandon. The three fused into a lizard covered in wood, with frost armor. It had an armored fish head with beak-like jaws. The three-way fusion shot a blue ice blast, the giant’s armor protected against it. The giant charged at the fish-reptile with a battle-axe. The fusion fought with its jaws, claws, and tail, it pulled back and shot another blast at the giant’s wing. The giant flew higher and dove again, the fusion chomped at a wing, it locked its jaws. The giant plunged to the ground, where Cody stabbed it with a spear.</p>
      <p>The Gibbons were five minutes away.</p>
      <p>The battle was concluding, most of Zror’s forces were in flight towards the gateway. Reqror, and some soldiers came at Cody, who struggled to defend. The general sliced at his shoulder, Cody dropped the spear, he guarded with his sword. Arrows shot at the soldiers, the general looked behind him. Mr. Gibbons drew a blue sword, his family shot the arrows. Mr. Gibbons clashed with Reqror.</p>
      <p>“That was a war.” Chris said, Zror’s forces had withdrawn. Reqror fled.
“You think it is over?” Cody asked. “No.” Gost said. “They’ll be back, soon.” Jasoner said. 
“Thank you.” Jake said.
“Happy to help.” Mr. Gibbons said.
“I better get going, I’ll be back.” Jasoner said.
