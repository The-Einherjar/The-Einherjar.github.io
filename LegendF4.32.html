      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 32</h2>
      Paul shot an orange blast; Grroror hit it with his mace. Brian tried to constrict Grroror, but took a blow from the bludgeon. Jonathan dived at the monster, nevertheless Grroror used his sting, and hit Jonathan’s poleax, it fell to the ground.
     <p>Jasoner, Cristine, Jaclyn, Paulius, Chris, and Osirisareses arrived. “It comes down to this, a battle, in which I will destroy the legendary heroes, defeat the four founders, and acquire the talismans. With them, I shall take over the two worlds. Prepare for the finale!” Zror declared. Jasoner ran toward Zror, who leaped over him. White energy shot at Zror from the founder’s blades, his cloak came off. Osirisareses flew toward Zror, and shot vines. Zror evaded them all and shot lightning at the dragon. Paulius swung his diamond blade, Zror blocked with his own sword.</p>
    <p>The Gibbons, Repti, and Garry were now helping to defeat Grroror, so was Gost and Cody. Gost used the Amphibian Talisman to transform.</p>
    <p>Zror shot a red energy blast at Osirisareses, who formed a green diamond energy shield, the energy reflected back at Zror. The emperor generated a barrier. “Prepare to face the terror of Trulor!” He shouted, he transformed into a terrible form, it looked like a dragon, and was red, with red eyes. It had razor claws; thorn-like spikes ran down its back. It tried to strike Jasoner with its claws, Osirisareses shot a diamond beam. Jasoner tried to attack, but was stopped by a purple beam shot from Zror’s dragon form. Zror clawed Osirisareses, the fusion struck the ground. Osirisareses looked at Jasoner, who nodded. They fused. The fusion looked like a dragon, but with tough purple fur. It had two wings, both with a green diamond spike. The claws were red, blue, and green diamond; the back had ice spikes running to its tail, and the forehead had a rainbow diamond. “So, you have fused into your most powerful form, the beast that defeated the Sorcerer… So much the better.” Zror said with an evil smile. Zror clawed the fusion, who struck Zror with his tail.</p>
    <p>Grroror struck with his tail, Repti used his energy shield to block, nonetheless, the shield shattered. Before Grroror finished them off, Mr. Gibbons came and parried Grroror’s mace with his sword. Grroror swung down again, silver light flashed from Alan’s sword. Grroror pushed downward, the silver light was too much, and he stopped for a second. That was all Mr. Gibbons needed, the father defending his children struck. Grroror collapsed and hit the ground.</p>
    <p>Wolf-Osirisareses struck with Talisar, Zror grabbed it with his claws, and then hit it with his tail, the sword hit the ground. Wolf-Osirisareses flew higher, Zror followed. The wolf dragon charged a green, blue, and yellow beam. Zror unleashed a purple energy ball, Wolf-Osirisareses evaded the attack. Wolf-Osirisareses, then shot his beam, it slammed into Zror. A purple flame came out of the beast's mouth, it hit, and Wolf-Osirisareses was weakened terribly. Zror charged, and rammed into Wolf-Osirisareses, the fusion fell, and Zror dived at him. The emperor latched onto the fusion dragon with his claws. ”So, ends, the legendary hero..” He said, raising his talons. Wolf-Osirisareses swiped Zror away with his tail. Wolf-Osirisareses charged a beam, and so did Zror. When they landed, they unleashed the beams. The two jets of energy met, and when they did, there was a large detonation.</p>
    <p>Paul, Brian, and Jordan fought the In Ar. Suddenly, the three tyrants of the Fire attacked. Flarog punched Brian, who was sent flying. It was Paul against the three Fire tyrants, now. “We heard about you, Paul. Jake worked hard to prepare you with your Talisman, but soon, Jake will out of what you call “High School”. You will replace him as general.” Treysor taunted. Embress swiped Paul, using her claws. “With you out of the way, everything will be united under our iron rule. You cannot stop us; lands will be burned.” She said, she swiped at Paul, but was blocked by an orange energy shield generated from Paul, who then charged orange energy; he discharged it, then flew at Embress, and sent her flying with a tail swipe. Embress was enraged, and sent Fire soldiers. The Fire tyrants fell back to watch. Paul watched in horror at the countless numbers of soldiers created in the Realm of Nightmares. Gost, Brian, and Jordan stared, with thousands of giant flame soldiers coming for the kill.</p>
