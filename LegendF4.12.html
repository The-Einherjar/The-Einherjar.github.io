      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
  It was six months after the Battle of Alderwood, Jake and Paul were playing chess in school. Jake moved a queen. “Are you sure?” A voice asked. “Ryan!” Jake exclaimed. Ryan was the wielder of the Fire Talisman. He was off on a long journey, but now he was back. “I heard that you had another villain.” He remarked.
      <p>They went outside. “It’s been six months since Jasoner left, we have not heard from him. We do not even know if he is alive.” Jake explained. “Hmm.” Ryan said, he was tall with red hair. “We thought about going to find him, but each time the decision was always the same. We just can’t leave and risk the chance that Jasoner will come while we were looking for him, or if Zror returns.” Jake continued. “Right.” Ryan said. “Which is a shame, I wanted to go see his world.” Paul said. “We thought about a spy, but no, he wouldn’t be familiar with the land. We don’t fully know the realm.” Jake added. “How about the battle? How did it turn out?” Ryan asked. “Minimal losses, many of us got bruises, cuts, and burns. Cody got a slash on his shoulder. If Mr. Gibbons didn’t intervene, I shiver to think.” Jake explained. “So, you have your Talisman?” Paul asked. “Yep.” Ryan said, pulling it out. It was round with an image of a flame.</p>
      <p>“We’re here!” Reqror laughed an evil laugh. With him, were six of his elite soldiers. They were in the forest where the army came during the Battle of Alderwood. “This time, we will not fail.“ He said.</p>
      <p>“Welcome back.” Brandon said. “Thanks.” Ryan responded. Jake, Trevor, Brandon, and Ryan were at a restaurant. “What was your most memorable battle?” Brandon asked. “Our last battle against Grutwaq.” Ryan answered. “For me, the last battle with Zron.” Trevor said. “Oh, yes.” Brandon uttered. “I don’t know, maybe Zron or the clash with Grutwaq at Mount Baker.” Jake said. "Probably, the last battle against Zron, because of the mere size of it. We were four hundred versus seven million, craziest thing we ever did. Anyway, welcome back Ryan, it seems like we may battle soon again. May we win.” Brandon said.</p>
