      <h1>Reptile Man</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
      The toad took the Gibbons north Jake, Alex, Brian and Troy began their pursuit. They eventually came  across a High School football field “Hope there are no guards.” Brian said. A few toads with hammers arrived "Magire Toad! Interferers!" Alex and Brian fought the toads, Jake and Troy charged toward the field.  The field was swamped, Magire Toad turned around. ”Like you I have ancient power not from the  four talismans because there are not any of those for amphibian. Only Reptile, Aqua, Plant and the most powerful one fire. I am searching for them all. If one can grant awesome power to one person, imagine what all four of them can do.  Once you are defeated I’ll take the Reptile Talisman” The toad said. 
The sword of changing glowed, Magire Toad transformed into a terrible form.  He had a frog like face, powerful frog legs, a long salamander tail, and four arms that looked like a combination of an amphibian and snake heads. Each of them had razor sharp jaws in its mouth. The toad charged. Jake turned into the reptile He chomped one of the toad’s snake arms with his croc jaws. The snake arm screeched terribly. The toad was busy with Troy. Troy started slashing the other three arms. The toad got Jake’s teeth off and the arm he bit shot a ball of acid, Jake barely dodged. Suddenly Troy was caught off guard. A spine stabbed Troy. “Troy!” Jake shouted. The toad tried to stab Jake, but he flew backwards with his wings. Jake jumped and whipped the toad with his tail. Jake tried a charge and bite but was stopped by Magire Toad’s acid. Jake was on the ground. The toad was over him with the needle. “The Reptile Talisman shall be mine!” Light lit up ”What?” When the light disappeared, a dragon appeared It was half human, fifty feet high with two wings, long brown hair white diamond armor,  gold claws tail had silver spikes “Who are you to interfere with our duel?” The toad asked. ”Your fiancé.” The dragon said  ”No...” Magire Toad said. The toad tried to pierce Jake, the dragon discharged radiant white and gold flames, Troy leaped and blocked the spine with his spear. The gold flames engulfed the toad The dragon turned into a human, it was Jill.
