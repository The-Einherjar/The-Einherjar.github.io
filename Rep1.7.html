      <h1>Reptile Man</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
      The toad took the Gibbons north. Jake, Alex, Brian, and Troy began their pursuit. They eventually came across a High School football field. “Hope there are no guards.” Brian said, a few toads with hammers arrived. "Magire Toad! Interferers!" Alex and Brian fought the toads, Jake and Troy charged toward the field. The field was swamped, Magire Toad turned around. ”Like you, I have ancient power. Not from the four talismans, none of the four is Amphibian. Only Reptile, Aqua, Plant, and the most powerful one, Fire. I am searching for them all. If one can grant awesome power to one, imagine what all four of them can do. Once you are defeated, I’ll take the Reptile Talisman!” The toad said. 
The sword of changing glowed, Magire Toad transformed into a terrible form. He was red and yellow, powerful frog legs, a long salamander tail, and two arms that looked like a combination of amphibian and snake heads, each of them had razor sharp jaws in the mouths. The toad charged. Jake turned into the reptile, he chomped one of the toad ’s snake arms with his croc jaws. The snake arm screeched terribly. Troy started slashing the other three arms. The toad got Jake’s teeth off, the arm he bit shot a ball of red energy, Jake barely dodged. "I did not recongize the Reptile guardian at the house. It was when you ran that I realized." The toad said. Suddenly, Troy was caught off guard, a spine slashed him. “Troy!” Jake shouted. The toad tried to stab Jake, but he flew backwards with his wings. He jumped and whipped the toad with his tail. Jake tried a charge and bite, but was stopped by red energy. Jake was on the ground, the toad was over him with the needles. “The Reptile Talisman shall be mine!” Light lit up. ”What?” The toad said, confused. When the light disappeared, a dragon appeared. It was forty feet high with two wings, long brown hair, white diamond armor, and gold claws, the tail had silver spikes. “And just who are you?” The toad asked. ”Your fiancé.” The dragon said  ”What?!” Magire Toad said, dumbfounded. The toad tried to pierce Jake, the dragon discharged radiant white and gold flames, Troy leaped and blocked the spine with his spear. The gold flames engulfed the toad. The dragon turned into a human, it was Jill.
