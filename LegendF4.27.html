      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 27</h2>
      “Emperor, there are visitors.” A fire creature said, a group of Insters were near. “Emperor Zror, we are the In Ars. We offer you a gift.” Their leader said. “What gift?” Zror asked. “A power so great, many have sought it.” The Inster replied. “What is this power?” Zror asked. “The Four Talismans.” The Inster answered. “They are Talismans that can change their owners into four beasts. Reptile, Plant, Aqua, and Fire. It is said that the one that has them all can rule the world.” That got Zror’s attention. “Allow me to see them, then.” Zror said. “That’s the difficulty, we don’t have them.” The Inster disclosed. “Where are they?” Zror asked. “Four humans have them.” The Inster responded. An evil smile appeared on Zror; he gave his unpleasant laugh without opening his mouth. “So, that’s the secret to their power. Now that I know, I can crush the “legendary hero”, and gather the legendary power and add it to my own.” He burst out with an evil laugh. “We will help you if you give us positions in your empire.” The Inster proposed. “Yes, I will make you my new Elites, Insters are powerful warriors.” Zror offered. “We accept.” The Inster said. “Now, for your first assignment, get me the Talismans. I have an evil design that will go with you.” Zror ordered. “Yes, our emperor.” The Inster finished.
