      <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
      No matter how fast they ran the fog never seemed to stop. They were getting tired. Eventually, they got to a stone area that where objects were visible. "We'll rest here.” Jasoner said. They stopped and collapsed to the ground. Osirisareses turned back into Trejakydon. Suddenly, three giants came out of nowhere and attacked. Jasoner, Verderk, and Trejakydon took their weapons to defend themselves. The giants didn’t do very well in this fight, and when they fell to the ground, clapping was heard. The three warriors turned around toward the thing that was clapping. “Excellent job my worthy enemies. Very impressive, when you defeated my other giants and took off into this fog, I thought you were all going to be too tired to defeat my second attack. However, I guess you are stronger menaces then I thought. Verderk Yashja, I’ve been hunting you down for a long time. You have been quite the trouble for us. You are a spy from Lulron, you stole five thousand gold from us, you led a band of rebels and destroyed the river fortress of Truleer, and then you and the rebels commandeered a fraction of the sorcerer’s fleet of warships and attacked a port fortress and sunk another fraction of the fleet of warships, and raided twenty million gold. Therefore, taking away forty three percent of the Trulor Empire’s money. We captured and imprisoned all but one of these rebels. Now I’ve got the final one, you!” A voice said.

He also had red eyes and two metal covered wings. “General Srimetal, we meet again.” Verderk said. “Yes, we do!” Srimetal bellowed, while drawing out his sword. Both Verderk and armored commander charged at each other with their swords. Verderk’s sword broke, he fell to the ground from the result of the force. “Anybody else?” Srimetal invited. Jasoner attacked, the  two fought. Trejakydon changed into Osirisareses, Srimetal aimed his crossbow at him. Jasoner threw his dagger, this delayed Srimetal, he was sliced by Osirisareses’s sword. “Well done.” Jasoner said. Verderk got up, Osirisareses turned back into Trejakydoin. They continued on and on until they finally got out of the fog. “Which way do we go now?” Trejakydon asked. “That way.” Jasoner answered, pointing to a desert with colossal crevices, the Canyon of Red Sunsets…
