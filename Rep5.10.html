    <h1>Reptile Man V: The Destiny of The Talismans</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
    Jordan knocked a plague creature in the air with his tail, he then flew and discharged a bronze beam and a silver beam, the two merged and detonated in a gold burst. He then slashed a creature with a fiery claw. Jill shot a fireball, it hit a creature. Ino slashed with a red energy blade. He gazed at the fog, he moved to the hill, he shot a red beam at a charging creature.
    <p>“There is a way you can defeat it. It is weakened, you can trap it in the  Talismans. There, we can destroy it.” Ino said. Osirisareses turned into their human forms. “How?” Trevor asked. “Place the Talismans on the ground where the plague’s center is, then guard.” Ino answered. The four positioned the Talismans, the stones  glowed green, brown, and orange. The fog climbed, there was a rumbling sound as if they were in the stomach of a monster. “Keep vigilant.” Gost said. The four took hold of their weapons. Plague creatures burst out of the fog. Gost slashed with his caecilian arms. Brandon fired a red diamond arrow. Trevor struck with his spear, Jake slashed his sword at a creature. Ryan clobbered a creature with his axe. Ino and the reptile slashed with claws. The fog down the hill was decreasing. Zarakqua took what energy it had, and constructed a form. It was tall, eight feet, was human-like in shape, it wielded a long sword. “Zarakqua.” Ino uttered. The reptile leaped at the form, Zarakqua caught him and thrust him into a rock. Aroseer and the Moltezron roared, they couldn’t see in the heightened fog. Ino pulled out a red diamond Inster sword. He slashed at Zarakqua, the plague blocked, it struck with its blade. Ino had a gash on his shoulder. Jake rushed at Zarakqua. Evading its sword, he attack with his. Zarakqua’s side was slashed. Trevor and Ryan confronted the plague. Trevor struck up with the spear, Zarakqua’s sword knocked the strike away, it rammed at Ryan. Brandon shot an arrow, it hit Zarakqua’s front. The plague struck at Ryan, gold fire erupted from the fog, as did Jill, she slashed Zarakqua’s arm. The plague slashed at her. Suddenly, a fiery tail smashed into Zarakqua, it dispersed into fog. A thunderous roar resounded from Aroseer, he saw Jill’s gold fire and whacked Zarakqua with his tail. The fog was extracted into the Talismans. “We got it.” Ryan said.</p>
