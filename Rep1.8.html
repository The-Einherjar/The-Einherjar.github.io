      <h1>Reptile Man</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
      <p>They were at their final approach. They already drove to Mount Baker, they were now climbing up the icy hill. They were five minutes to the crater, Jake was full of questions. He was ready for what was inside the crater, as well. Jake was curious, however. He caught up with Jill, who was way ahead. “Hey, Jill, how did you...?” He asked. ”I don’t know.” Jill said. Suddenly, a creature revealed itself in front of them, it was Ino the creature Jake saw in his dream. “So, we meet again.” Ino said. “We have climbed this place, now what?” Jake asked. “Now, that you have found me, you must take them to the wall of Zat, an ancient place in these mountains that will seal that menace once again.” Ino said. Suddenly, there was an evil laugh, the thing revealed itself. “Grutwaq.” Ino said. Ino leaped at Grutwaq, Ino’s insect claws glowed and two orange energy blades popped out of each claw, he started to fight Grutwaq with them. Grutwaq punched Ino, causing him to fall to the ground. Jake turned into his Talisman form. Grutwaq shot purple energy ball, Alex deflected the energy with his sword. Jake clawed Grutwaq, but as usual, it had no effect. Grutwaq shot another attack at Jake, Reptile Man stuck the ground. Grutwaq grinned, he snapped. Ten smaller rubber creatures floated in the air. “This is way I was gone, I summoned my minions!” Grutwaq said, he jumped into the crater. “You get the stone tablet from the wall to seal him, it is the only way.” Jake said, pointing to the Gibbons. “I’ll go distract him, me and Ino. Alex, Brian, and Troy shall escort you.” Jake said. “But, you can’t beat Grutwaq.” Jill said. “That is true, but me and Ino can distract him long enough, then you will finish him.” Jake said, the Gibbons went. “Now, let’s finish this!” Jake said. He and Ino jumped into the crater.</p>
      <p>Jake and Ino landed on the hard surface of a large rounded rock in the middle of the boiling lava. In front of them, was Grutwaq. “So, you demand we finish this war? I could finish off your friends right now, but to make my revenge more interesting, I’ll just eliminate the ones who oppose me, first!” Grutwaq said. The three circled each other, waiting for someone to launch the first attack. </p>
      <p>The Gibbons ran toward the ancient cave, the minions were chasing after them. Suddenly, they all were out of sight. “We did they go?” Mrs. Gibbons said. “Never mind, get to that cave!” Mr. Gibbons exhorted.</p>
      <p>The three were still circling. Grutwaq shot a purple ball at Jake, it exploded. Jake was hurt, but not defeated.</p>
      <p>The Gibbons and their escorts made it into the cave. “There it is: the tablet and Wall of Zat.”  Troy said. Suddenly, the eight minions attacked. Alex, Brian and Troy fought them, while the Gibbons went to get the tablet.</p>
      <p>Ino fired red energy, Grutwaq emerged out unharmed. Jake turned invisible, Grutwaq fired a purple beam at him. Jake turned visible again, Grutwaq can detect him even when invisible. Jake unfolded his flying lizard wings and flew overhead while Ino continued his bombardment. Jake felt strange power within his grasp, Grutwaq was battering Ino. Jake suddenly, breathed a large blue plasma beam. It struck with great force, Grutwaq fell over. Jake shot another, the blast lit up the entire crater. “Where are they?” Ino said. Grutwaq got up, angry. He shot pulses of purple energy at both Ino and Jake. Jake shot the blast again, Grutwaq managed to block it with his own purple beam. The Gibbons entered the crater. “Jake, we got it!” Mr. Gibbons said. “Good.” Ino replied, still trying to hold Grutwaq off. “Use it now, we are almost out of energy.” Ino said. Mr. Gibbons took the sword that belonged to their ancestor. “The Sword of Kzat!” Grutwaq said in horror. Mr. Gibbons read the tablet. “Elements of Zat, Kzat, and Qzat, it is time that this enemy is stopped, I establish the power of Gzat!” He then threw the sword. It struck Grutwaq, red and blue and green and pink energies surrounded it. “No!” Grutwaq cried. That was the last thing they heard before he was trapped in stone. “He is gone.” Brian said. “It’s over!” Jake exclaimed. “Success!” Brian shouted. They all went out of the hot crater. “Garry can come back.” Ino said. “Perhaps when you get home, since his jailer is gone.”</p>
      <p>It was a pool and pizza party at the Gibbons again. Jake was there, so was Brian. “Well Jake, I’m going to eat.” Brian said. “I’ll stay here for a while.” Jake said. Suddenly, someone tapped Jake on the shoulder. Jake turned around, and just as he expected, it was Jill. “Hi, Jake, guess who is back.” She said. Garry came up. “Garry! Welcome back!” Jake said. “Thanks Jake, I’m glad that thing will not cause trouble anymore, that is for sure.” Garry said. After that, an old Indian man came up. “It’s you.” Jake said. “Who is he?” Garry asked. “I don’t know him. Who is he Jake?” Jill asked. “He is the one who gave me the Reptile Talisman.” Jake answered. “Yes, I am, and I wanted to say something. I did not just give it because I wanted to. I did it because I felt you were meant to have it, not just for one destiny. You have to decide what to do with it when the power is given to you...”</p>
