    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    “Here it comes.” Ino said, looking at the dark clouds that covered the mountain. They had relocated to gain ground for the battle.  There was a loud roar in the air “Moltezron!” Garry exclaimed. “It looks like he is not alone.” Troy uttered. Two more shapes moved closely behind the creature. There were Moltezrons, they came at Gost and the others. The four fused into Osirisareses, Gost landed on the dragon’s shoulder. The plague sent three dark spheres, each of them hit a Moltezrons, they then took shapes of plague Moltezrons. The Moltezrons recognized that it was the plague, they immediately attacked. The plague sent another sphere, Osirisares dodged it, then shot a fire stream, destroying it. He then flew towards a plague Moltezron, and shot a fire/solar ray at it, the plague Moltezrons shot a fireball in response. Gost shot acid, the Plaguezron roared. A gold fireball fired from Jill. It struck, the Plaguezron  dissolved. Two Moltezrons were on the ground, overwhelmed. The other two Plaguezrons shot toward Jill, they discharged magma. Jill’s wings dispersed the lava. She clawed a Plaguezron, her claw glowed. A Plaguezron charged, Jill struck with her tail. She released a storm of fire, the Plaguezron disappeared. Suddenly, a dark sphere hit he plague couldn’t duplicate Jill, however, she was  paralyzed. The third Plaguezron altered its arm into a talon, it struck toward Jill, but it stopped and roared, it disappeared, the third Moltezron had rammed it with its blade. The plague went back to the mountain, for now.
