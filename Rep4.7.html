    <h1>Reptile Man IV: The Flames of Rorzron</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
      It was Friday morning, and not sunny at all. Fog was in the air, and clouds covered the sky. Not little white clouds, but huge dark storm clouds, but there was no storm, only silence. Troy and Ryan were on the football field at their school. It was not long until Jill came. A dark shape appeared in the clouds. “Not again.” Troy said. “What?” Ryan asked. He looked up at the clouds. “A tornado?” He asked. “No worse, it’s the Zorraider!” Troy shouted. “Oh, that thing.” Ryan said. He turned into Fire Reptile Man. “Bring it on.” He said. The Zorraider landed its dragon and spoke. “Give it to me.” It said in a cold voice. “Come and get it!” Ryan replied. “Get inside, I’ll hold him.” He added.
      <p>At that exact same time at Mountlake Terrace, a huge number of dark shapes were headed towards the building. Inside, Jake was walking in the halls near the hub. “What’s that noise?” He asked. “I don’t know. It sounds like an army marching right....towards us.” David said. The two ran to the entrance of the school and saw the dark shapes. “Shadowlings! Xroyadrick must have sent them.” Jake said. “Lock the doors!” David called out. The janitors came over and used their keys to lock the entrance. Jake went to his locker to get a war horn, he then went back to the entrance. He blew the horn, the noise echoed through the entire building. Jake went to the roof and turned into Reptile Man. David put on his armor but remained near the doors. Up on the roof, and near the doors came thousands of creatures from underground, Jake’s army of Insters also came to the roof and in other places. The Shadowlings were now thirty feet away from the building. “Catapults fire!” Jake ordered. Catapults that were mounted to the schools fired huge stones at the invaders. Other catapults fired at the school as well. Jake shot a fire ball, it destroyed one of the Shadowling’s catapults. The army of Xroyadrick still moved toward the school without any signs of fear. The creatures on the roof fired catapults, some rocks missed, some hit enemies, some hit other catapults, and some hit other stones from the enemy catapults. Hawks flew from the school and started to attack Shadowlings. The Shadowlings got closer, they were moving at a slow pace, but they were still likely to reach the doors.</p>
      <p>Ryan shot another fire ball at the Zorraider. The dark knight got angry and threw its axe at Ryan, but it was countered by a fire shield. Ryan flew and circled the Zorraider. “I’m warning you, give me what I came for or you will pay!” The Zorraider demanded. Ryan shot a stream of fire as an answer. The Zorraider got on its dragon and attacked Ryan in the air, the two were now in a dog fight. “We should help him.” Troy said. “Totally.” Jill replied, she drew her sword. The Zorraider took a whip and struck Ryan with it, an arrow hit the dragon’s wing.</p>
      <p>“Rebreyot!” A Shadowling shouted. A big battering ram took its first hit at the locked doors. “To the doors! All down stair soldiers to the doors!” David ordered. More creatures swarmed into the upstairs hub. More catapults fired, one hit and broke to pieces, the glass pyramid that was standing over the hub. “Rebreyot!” Another crash on the door was heard, there were some cracks. Meanwhile, outside, the militia of Insec It, a stronghold of Terrace and Lynnwood creatures arrived and charged into the enemy ranks. “Rebreyot!” The door was almost broken. “Rebreyot!” The door was broke open, the Shadowlings roared. Arrows were fired by the Terrace soldiers. “Draw swords and charge!” David commanded. Every creature guarding the door drew their swords, or axes, or spears, or whatever they had, and ran into the Shadowlings. Jake in the meantime, kept commanding the catapult fire. “Am I the only one besides  David, that is commanding around here?” He asked himself. Suddenly, Cody came to the roof, held up a sword, and blew a horn. His flying chariots, the same that raided Rorzron came flying at the Shadowlings and attacked them. David was holding off the invading Shadowlings that came in the door. More Shadowlings came to a door beneath the bridge that led to the main entrance, they had another battering ram. “Rebreyot!” They started to hit the door. “Inoiker, follow me down. The rest of you fire at your own will.” Jake said. He and some of his Insters went to the bottom gate. “Prepare to fire!” Jake ordered. His Insters took bows and knocked their arrows. The door broke and a dozen Shadowlings came in. “Fire!” Jake yelled out. Fifty arrows shot and hit them. “Sound the war horn” Jake ordered. An Inster blew a horn and all of them charged into the Shadowling ranks.</p>
      <p>“Give me the gem!” The Zorraider roared. The Zorraider flew over to Jill. Ryan moved in the way and shot a fire blast. “You are getting on my nerves.” The Zorraider said. “You will not get it.” Jill stated. The Zorraider laughed an evil laugh. “So little girl, you want to see Zron’s armies? And you want him to attack this school and besiege it to the ground, eh? Don’t joke around with a Zorraider if you know what’s good for you. Perhaps next time you will be careful what you wish for, that is if there is a next time for you. Or maybe Zron will have mercy on you, if you become his house servant and make sure the tower is in perfect condition. That will be decided later. The armies of Zron will not fail to defeat you. This is the last victory you’ll have, so enjoy it. We shall meet each other in battle again.” The Zorraider said, it flew off towards Rorzron.</p>
      <p>Xroyadrick’s forces were not far from victory. Neither Jake, David, or Cody could last much longer. Shadowlings were pouring into the building in gigantic numbers. Things looked bad. “We tried.” David said quietly. Suddenly, on the horizon, the sun started to come up from the fog. Thousands of figures and shapes appeared on the hill in front of the school. It was Meadowdale and Edmonds Woodway’s forces. “Okay then, we arrived at a point where they are barley holding on. Gretekus, prepare to sound the horn.” Danny said. “We will take them by charging as fast and powerful as possible when the horn is sounded.” Richard ordered. The horn blew, they all charged down and struck every Shadowling that came across their path. They kept charging until they broke into the main enemy ranks. Jake and David finally got the chance to charge into the remaining enemy ranks as well. The battle lasted for twenty minutes until finally the last Shadowling was hit by an arrow.</p>
