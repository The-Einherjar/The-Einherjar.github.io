      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 16</h2>
 “Welcome, young founders, we have planned the wedding date, three days.” Zror declared. He, Jaclyn, and Cristine were at a gold table. “You sure know how to thrill us.” Jaclyn said dully. “I think you will be thrilled. You will be married to a Lord of Trulor, the soon-to-be greatest empire. When I am done, it will be this world and your world.” Zror said. Cristine laughed. “What a one tract mind you probably have.” She said. Zror gave an evil smile. “Regrettably, I don’t have time for all your humor. I have the greatest army ever assembled in Trulaz, and three days to reach the location you’ll get married.” He replied. “Where?” Jaclyn asked. “Luris Coldor, the greatest city in this world. I’ll conquer it, and then publicly marry you two to my two generals. The more witnesses I get, the better the word goes to the Republic.” Zror said. “If you force us and they know…” Jaclyn started. “But they won’t.” Zror cut her off. “Want to know something? One of my army’s factors is “fear”. Which they easily do because they are creatures of nightmare in this world. That is a reason why we lost the battle against your world, we did not scare them as easy. Brave, they are, but then again, I have planned for them. ” Zror said.
      <p>The trip past the Canyon of Red Sunsets was quick due to the four talisman wielders fusing. The fusion was a thirty-two-foot-high dragon. This dragon had diamond armor, the head was shaped like Jake’s talisman head. The wings, shoulders, and the back and the tail had spikes on them. The end of the tail looked like a fish tail, and the head had a horn. The arms had ice covering the armor, for extra protection. Each of the claws were actually thorns, the same applied to the legs, except without the ice. They flew with Paulius and Chris on their back. They reached a mountain cave, the fusion changed back to Ryan, Trevor, Brandon, and Jake. They entered the cave. “So, what exactly is it you are searching for?” Chris asked. “Thousands of years ago, tales talked of a powerful force. The sorcerer wanted to find this energy, he almost got it, but was stopped in the Battle of the Canyon of Red Sunsets. Many centuries later, the banished sorcerer returned. The legendary hero got the Vlfirpotence, and helped defeat the threat. We were the legendary hero.” Ryan answered. “We?” Paulius asked. “We were fused.” Brandon said. After a few minutes, they made it to a stone. There was a hole that looked like a sword could fit in. “You first.” Ryan said to Trevor. Trevor had a sword, he stuck the blade in the hole, orange energy flashed. Trevor quickly drew the sword out. Brandon, who had a sword did the same, so did Ryan and Jake. They went outside, there was a creature in gold and red armor on a dragon. Behind him, were dozens of other Trulor warriors, some rode on huge bats. The leader, the one with the dragon laughed. “We saw a dragon flying, we know who you are. The emperor will be pleased with me, once we deliver you to him. Once he gets the power, I will be a general! Charge!” He shouted. The creatures attacked.
Jake, Ryan, Trevor, and Brandon transformed. Ryan shot a fireball, it hit a bat, and the creature fell. Brandon shot solar heat blasts at bats, Trevor froze bats, and Jake shot green-blue energy at a bat. When the armored soldiers collided with the four, a sword fight became of it. Each of the swords of the four turned orange, it was the energy of the Vlfirpotence. Chris, and Paulius fought, also. Ryan engaged the captain. The dragon shot fire, Ryan was protected by his diamonds. Ryan’s blade was seven feet long, the blade was diamond, with rainbow colors on the blade, the handle was gold with silver lines, and four diamonds, each had its own color: green, brown, orange, and blue. Ryan swung it; the sword glowed orange with the Vlfirpotence, the captain fell to the ground. All remaining creatures fled. They left behind a prisoner, a young woman. “Help! I was asked to escape and get help. My people have been captured, and are going to be slaves, I heard last night, that we will be separated. My family and I, will be. Please help us.” She cried. The seven looked across the canyon. It was night, and they saw a huge army.
