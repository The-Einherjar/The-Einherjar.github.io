<p>And On Flameritilquaoak’s Eve Stop The Plague’s rebirth?” Jill asked. “Yes, that is indeed exactly what I am talking about.” Ino said. There was a sizeable clamor outside. “What was that noise?” Jill asked. “What noise?” Trevor, who was sleepy, asked. “That strange roaring sound outside.” Jill replied. “It’s too big and strange to be a truck.” Ryan said. “Let’s go check it out.” Brandon said as they all turned into their talisman forms.</p>
