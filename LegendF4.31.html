      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 31</h2>
      They were in a rocky area with snow, with mountains circling. Zror‘s forces were ahead of them. “This is it.” Trevor said. “It comes down to this battle.” Jake uttered; he observed the great army. “Twenty million.. That’s what Inokrezidir calls “slow readiness”!? Anyhow, he wasn’t kidding, we must stop Zror, right here.”
      <p>“Crush them all, except Cristine and Jaclyn. Bring me the Talismans.” Zror ordered. A war horn signaled the attack.</p>
      <p>A glow came from the western part of the Olympics, a light then shot out, it looked like the Northern Lights. “That is, it.” Trevor uttered. The expeditionary force and the armies of the republic and Luris Coldor appeared out of the light, as did Jasoner. They sounded a war horn. “Now!” Gost shouted. A war horn was sounded from the Four Schools, they charged with Luris Coldor, and the republic. Gost, Jake, Brandon, Ryan, Trevor, Paul, and Brian. Jasoner transformed into the wolf fusion. The three Talisman dragons flew overhead. The Shadow Osirisareses soared at them, Jake, Brandon, Ryan, and Trevor fused and rocketed toward it. The two forces met, and so did Osirisareses, and the nightmare dragon. Zror’s army was flanked by the Trulaz forces. Talisar was hit by the nightmare fusion’s claws, it dropped from Osirisareses’s hand. The Shadow Osirisareses shot his vines, but Osirisareses knew how to counter, he shot fire.</p>
      <p>Repti had caught the scent, Mr. Gibbons fought toward where his family was. Garry, who was armed with a golden sword, helped him.</p>
      <p>Cristine, Jaclyn, Paulius, and Chris fought with their diamond swords. Reqror came towards them, he swung his sword at Paulius, Chris got in the way and parried the strike. Cristine then swung her sword, white energy shot at Reqror.</p>
      <p>Jasoner rushed toward the nightmare fusion, but he was halted by two winged creatures, the ones that attacked the Talisman wielders on the sound.</p>
      <p>The Shadow Osirisareses shot a red and purple energy blast, and Osirisareses shot his yellow, green, and white beam. Osirisareses’s ray hit the nightmare fusion’s, the beams detonated in a blazing flare. The nightmare slammed its tail against Osirisareses, who shot an ice blast. The ice covered the nightmare fusion. The four wrapped thorns around the Shadow Osirisareses, and flung it downward, and then shot another beam. The nightmare fusion hit the ground, it shot lava at Osirisareses, the green diamond dragon shot ice. The lava turned to rock; Osirisareses used his wings to send the rocks back at the shadow fusion. The Shadow Osirisareses generated a red and purple energy shield, the rocks bounced off of it. They fell harmlessly. Osirisareses glowed, and turned into a powerful creature. It was like an upgraded version of Osirisareses. It had an orange diamond on its forehead; the thorn claws were extended, and they turned into green diamond blades, its wings sparkled like a diamond, the diamond armor grew stronger, and had diamond spikes. The nightmare fusion got hit by a green energy beam sent by the diamond dragon. The Shadow Osirisareses’s diamond armor cracked, it shot an ice ray from its mouth. Osirisareses tore through it with his claws. Osirisareses clawed the nightmare dragon, the shadow fusion’s diamond armor shattered, and the Shadow Osirisareses dissolved into gray mist.</p>
      <p>Jill, Brianna, Shealee, Mallory, Caleb, Teagan, and Inokrezidir were in a tent, surrounded by guards. Garry, Repti, and Mr. Gibbons entered the tent, they fought the guards. When the guards were not aiming their spears toward the captives, Jill changed into her winged  form, Repti released the others with his talons. Garry handed them bows and swords.</p>
      <p>Jonathan, who was riding the Silver Dragon, wore gray and red armor and was armed with a poleax, he, Brian, and Paul engaged a fierce monster. He looked like he was made out of rubber; he was fourteen feet tall with a tail with a sharp sting, he stood on two legs, had sharp claws, and wielded a steel mace. He laughed. “You think you can defeat me? I am Grroror!”</p>
      <p>Jasoner defeated the winged creatures, four more attacked. Jill transformed into her dragon form, she took to the air and fired a gold and white blaze. A winged shadow creature dissipated into gray mist, another clawed at Jill, her claws ignited with white energy, and she struck, the creature dissolved. Jasoner shot lightning spheres from his two scorpion tails, the orbs collided with the winged creature, and the beast vanished into fog. “Thank you.” Jasoner said, he shot after Zror.</p>
      <p>Osirisareses fought his way back and retrieved Talisar. He shot towards Zror, fighting as he went along.</p>
      <p>Zror was watching, he had his silver blade; he had spotted Osirisareses, Jasoner, Cristine, Jaclyn Paulius, and Chris. All were coming toward him. “Yes, come.” He laughed. The legendary heroes were very powerful, they had defeated the shadow fusion. “But, they won’t defeat the emperor.” Zror said.</p>
