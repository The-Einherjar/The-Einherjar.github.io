    <h1>Reptile Man IV: The Flames of Rorzron</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
      All of them were there. They were all armed. Richard had a silver spear and a golden bow and a quiver full of brass arrows with red diamonds decorated on them. Danny had an axe . Jill still had her bow, and long light sword from the last crisis. David Fazio had armor, a scimitar, and a mace. Troy had a spear, and Jake, Brandon, Ryan Trevor, and Gost did not seem to have any weapons, but they said they were set.
      <p>The huge mountain, Mount St. Helens was only zero feet away from them. That’s right, they were in the gigantic crater making their way toward the lava dome where the entrance to the caverns were. “So, is it dark in the caves?” Richard asked. “Not really, there is a lot of light that comes from the lava lakes.” Gost said. “Lava lakes?” Richard said looking surprised. “You never said anything about lava lakes, not to me at least.” Danny said. “Don’t worry about them, worry about the forces of Growun that still remain there. Here is the lava dome.” Gost said as they walked in a hole at the side of the rock. They followed Gost to a dark hole with some red light coming out of it. “Here it is, the secret entrance to the caverns of the Wall of Rorzron.” Gost announced. They slowly went inside, after a short walk through the tunnel, they came to a great cave with lots of red light and writing all over the walls, and the giant lava lakes with lots of bridges over them. Richard and Danny were speechless. The only sounds were the lava pits burning and making splash sounds as the lava hit the rocks. Suddenly, from behind a large rock came talking. “They went to Mons Surprem, eh?” One Stouse asked. “Yes, they said that they were going to recreate our old empire.” A second said. “With two Stouses? Hahaha! Those two always made me laugh, besides we can’t bring our empire back to its original glory if all of us went. The old empire had over ten times as much Stouses then all of the Stouses in this cave.” A third said. “At least we’ve got one of master Growun’s old “pet lizards”, the only surviving one that I’m aware of.” The first said. Gost and the others thought they could slip through unnoticed, and they tried. “Hey! What was that?” The second shouted. “Intruders!” The first replied. “Where’s the horn?” The third asked. A loud horn echoed through the caverns and a red fiery thing with a Stouse came flying over. Sounds of Stouses could be heard. “Lava Dragon!” Brandon exclaimed. Jill and Richard took their bows and started to fire arrows at the flying thing with lava. Suddenly, two more lava dragons came out the lava. Ryan, Jake, Brandon, Trevor, and Gost activated their talismans. Trevor shot an ice blast at one of the dragons, the dragon shot lava, the molten rock intercepted the ice. Brandon shot a solar blast at the dragon’s head. This stopped the lava stream, Trevor’s ice hit and froze dragon. The second dragon after David. Jake shot a plasma fire ball, the dragon turned around. Ryan then slammed into the dragon, who hit a rock and was knocked out. The third dragon tried to dive bomb Gost, but kept missing. Gost jumped at it, and pushed the Stouse off. He took control of the dragon, himself. “Anybody who can’t fly, on here!” He said. Everyone, except for Trevor and Ryan jumped on, except for Brandon, who had a heavy tree body, he was instead picked up by Ryan. Jake was holding on the dragon’s tail. Richard, David, and Danny were surprised that Ryan was Fire Reptile Man and Trevor was Fish Master and so on and so forth.</p>
