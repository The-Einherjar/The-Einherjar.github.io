      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 19</h2>
   “Luris Coldras.” Willius said, ahead of them was a fortress. Stone walls surrounded it. They went in, there were blue clad soldiers inside; on the catwalks, were giant crossbows, there were a few trebuchets inside the fortress as well. A soldier ran over to the seven young men, Ryan recognized him. “Jasoner?” He asked. The guy looked at Ryan. “Where were you?” Jake asked. “Sorry, I was busier than I thought. Zror is moving quickly. I see you rescued the rest of the captives.” Jasoner said. “Jasoner!” Willius shouted. “Glad to see you’re alright, the rest of your people are here.” Jasoner said. “They are?” Willius asked. “Yes, the men volunteered in the army of Luris Coldor. They were stationed here.” Jasoner replied. “So, anything new?” Jasoner asked. The seven told him what happened, from the kidnapping, to present. “Hmm… I’ll tell you what happened here.” Jasoner said, he told them about the conquest of Willius’s nation and others. In fact, Jasoner planned to go back to Earth, but the invasion of Willius’s people halted that, it had to be defended quickly because of the strategic location of it. It was sunset, the night watch came. “I’ll help you rescue the two girls.” Jasoner said. “Yeah, we better get them home before we continue the war here.” Trevor said. Suddenly, a horn blew from a lookout man. Jasoner and the seven, who were on the catwalk, looked across the walls. Thousands of dark shapes moved quickly towards the fortress. “Zror’s army, part of it!” Ryan exclaimed. “We need to evacuate.” A man said. “Too late they’ll go after the escapees. Light the fire to alert Luris Coldor.” Jasoner advised. Luris Coldor was seven miles away. “Prepare for war!” The captain ordered.
   <p>Some of the prisoners that were rescued were armed, they volunteered. The seven young men received armor. “They must have captured our lookouts out there. That is why we were caught by surprise.” A solider said. “How many are there?” Another asked. “I’d say, maybe three hundred thousand.” Jasoner answered. “What?! We only have eight hundred, are you sure we shouldn’t fall back, this is a lookout post isn’t it?” The solider asked. “Well, now it is more of a lookout post, but it was built as a strong defense, when even Luris Coldor was young. We are waiting for the army from Luris Coldor to assist us because falling back is too risky, here stand a better chance. Trust me; I know the creatures of Trulor, they are fast during the night, faster than any human or elf.” Jasoner explained, he looked at the Trulor army. “Here we go, again.” Trevor said, Jake nodded. “Let’s finish this, defeat this army, go after Zror, rescue Cristine and Jaclyn, and defeat Zror.” He said.</p>
