      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 29</h2>
     “Who are you?” The Marineer asked. The Marineers looked like elves covered in fishlike scales, they had blue armor. The four had stumbled on the Marineer’s settlement, they lived in an underground chamber, where there was dry land. The chamber was large enough to have thousands living in it. It was more like a city. Buildings towered over the four young men’s heads. “We are here to help you.” Brandon said. “With….” The Marineer inquired. “The Marrzrons. They are allies with an emperor, and are trying to conquer.” Trevor said. “We know of this.” The Marineer replied, polity. “Our reason for coming here is to form an alliance.” Ryan proclaimed. “We have not gone up to the surface for…” The Marineer said, but his eyes went toward someone. Mr. Gibbons was walking toward him. “How did you get down here?” Trevor asked. A sea serpent transformed into Brian, and tossed his Talisman in his palm. “Inokrezidir has been taken prisoner. That’s not all.” Mr. Gibbons said with worried face. “They’ve taken…Jill, Brianna, Shealee , Mallory, Caleb, and Teagan.” He said. Jake was speechless with shock. “Where?” Ryan asked. “I know where.” The Marineer said, he looked at Mr. Gibbon’s sword. “Is that the legendary Sword of Kzat?” The Marineer asked. “Yes.” Mr. Gibbons said. “We were friendly with Kzat. That is the sword of the legendary warrior, Gibbons. What is your name?” The Marineer asked. “Alan Gibbons.” Mr. Gibbons answered. “I am Setgibbis, leader of the Marineers.” The Marineer said.
    
      <p>The Marineers agreed to make an alliance. The four went places to get allies. Jake went to southeastern Washington to ally with the Gorzos, reptilian beasts. Ryan helped the alliance prepare, Trevor and Brandon went to Trulaz.</p>
