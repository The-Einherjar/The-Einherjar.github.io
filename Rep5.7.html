    <h1>Reptile Man V: The Destiny of The Talismans</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
    Jill collapsed, she turned into her human form. “What is happening to her?” Mr. Gibbons asked, he rushed to Jill. “The plague was incapable of duplicating her, but the dark sphere has drained her.” Ino answered. “Is she going to be okay?” Jake inquired. “She should. However, she won’t be battling for a time.” Gost said. “The most powerful of us is immobilized. What are we going to do?” Ryan asked. Ino  thought. “A few thousand years ago, there were a series of dragons, each one had a connection to the Talismans. Osirsareses is one of them. The others are in other realms. It is said that one would enter this world to help battle the plague.” He explained. “When will-“ Trevor started. A red mist gate opened in the sky, there was a loud roar. The fog cleared up to reveal a hundred foot long dragon. This dragon had four giant wings and was red with  razor claws. On its back was a towering spine in the middle, it glowed as lightning, fire, and ice surrounded it. It had green eyes and its tail had two axe blades. “It is Aroseer.” Ino said.
    <p>The plague came to meet its new rival. The other four turned into their talisman forms. He asked. The four talisman bearers glowed  and fused. “Another battle, already?” They asked. The dark cloud shot four lightning bolts, an explosion was triggered. when the smoke cleared there was a plague creature. This creature looked like a dragon without a tail, it was covered in black armor and had a horn on its head shaped like and axe. Six tentaclelike things with thorns came out of its back. The creatures soared towards Osirisareses, it stretched its tentacles. Osirisareses stopped them with thorn claws, they grabbed the tentacles, then threw the creature to the ground. The thing then shot a black and white beam from its mouth, it struck Osirisareses and caused him to collapse. Aroseer shot a bright red flame at the plague creature. When the flame was gone, the thing was gone. It appeared behind the dragon, however, the dragon knew it was there. With a rush, the dragon’s tail struck, slashing a large puncture in the thing’s armor. Osirsareses took off and rammed into the creature. Tentacles sliced at Osrisareses. The talisman fusion fought back with a stream of ice, the creature’s tentacles were frozen. Aroseer tried to crush the thing with its massive jaws. Four tentacles  cracked out of the ice, they pushed the jaw upward. Osirisareses shot a fire beam from his mouth. Aroseer shot a fire stream, the creature faded into fog. Osirisareses turned back into his four original forms, the plague fell back towards the mountain.</p>
