      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 17</h2>
      The eight hid behind a rock. “There are a lot of them.” Brandon said, indicating the army. ”Soldiers have been gathering.” The girl said. “They had about ten thousand when they attacked our capital, now they have around eight hundred thousand.” She said. “Eight hundred thousand!?” Trevor barley said. “Ok, I have a plan, but first, I need a layout of the camp.” Ryan said. “The captives are guarded, a hundred feet that way.” The girl said pointing. “My plan, is for Jake, Trevor, Brandon, and I to attack, while Paulius, and Chris sneak. We will say that we are the legendary hero, and they will blindly attack us. Who will pay attention to two teens while we are attacking?” Ryan asked.
      <p>They separated. The four shouted, a few creatures came to attack. The four drew their swords. A small fight occurred; the four used the Vlfirpotence in their attacks. A bat rider, an old experienced one, saw Ryan’s blade. “The Legendary hero!” He roared. “Everyone, attack!” He shouted. Pandemonium spread quickly. Soon, lots of creatures launched an unorganized assault. The four transformed.</p>
      <p>Paulius and Chris sneaked to the captives. The area was virtually deserted, no guards guarded. One of the captives was wearing white armor. “I am a warrior of the mountain republic, are you two of the founders?” He asked. “Yes.” Chris said. “They have the girls.” The soldier said. “Where?” Paulius asked. “Middle of the camp.” The soldier answered. Just as the prisoners sneaked out, there were noises of more soldiers coming. “We have to go.” Chris reluctantly said.</p>
      <p>The four still held their ground. There were more noises of soldiers coming, the prisoners sneaked away. A Trulor soldier saw the prisoners, he shouted to others. Many went after the escapees. Paulius, Chris, and two others, who recovered their weapons, including the white clad solider, fought back. Ryan, who was fighting a soldier mounted on a dragon, shot a Vlfirpotence blast at the dragon and went to help. The three other Talisman wielders went to assist, also. The fight turned into a chase. It lasted for an hour, when the Trulor solider were ordered to stop. Jake turned to a man who fought alongside them. “Willius?” He . “Indeed, it is me. We can’t go back to our country.” Willius stated. “How about Luris Coldor?” Brandon suggested. “There will go, then. We can’t go east.” Willius said. “I better go to report my information to the mountains.” The white clad soldier said.</p>
