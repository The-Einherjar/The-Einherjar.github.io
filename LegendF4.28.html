      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 28</h2> 
     It was dawn, the Four Talisman wielders were near Puget Sound. A figure came toward them. “Talisman wielders.” It said. “Inokrezidir?” Jake asked. “Yes.” The Inster answered. “I come to you at a desperate time, for evil Insters, known as the In Ar, have joined an evil emperor, and they are after the Talismans. The emperor’s name is Zror.” He continued. “Zror?” Brandon asked. “He is here then, in this world.”  Trevor said. “He is gaining allies as we speak. You must do the same. Zror is twisting creatures in the Realm of Nightmares; in a month, he will have an army so powerful, he will be almost unstoppable.” The Inster explained. “Get Zror to attack sooner.” He advised. “Who is Zror allying with?” Trevor asked. “Gitzons, Stouses, the Fire, and the Marrzrons. The Marrzrons are underwater creatures, but they can fight on dry land.” Inokrezidir answered. “The Fire warriors that attacked were allied to the emperor.” Ryan realized. “Zror is slow at his readiness, right now, but you need allies.” The Inster said. “Who?” Jake asked. “The Marineers.” Inokrezidir replied. “They haven’t left the water for centuries.” Trevor uttered. “This concerns them.” Inokrezidir responded. “You four, must lead the Alliance to battle, and defeat the forces of tyranny.” He added. Suddenly, figures came, one laughed. “The In Ar!” Inokrezidir shouted. The four transformed, and Inokrezidir readied his claws. Roars filled the air. Two terrible winged creatures were in the sky, they were scaly, had red eyes, wicked claws, their scales were gray; they also had red lines on their shoulders. The four young men fused; the fusion shot two ice blasts from each of its icy arms. The two creatures avoided the subzero assault. The In Ar drew their swords, Inokrezidir, fought them with his own blade. Osirisareses defended against the winged beasts. Then, another winged beast arrived, it was a thirty-two-foot-high dragon with two wings. This dragon had black diamond armor, the head was shaped like Jake’s talisman head, and had a yellow horn. The end of the tail looked like a fish tail. The arms had lava covering the armor, for extra protection. Each of the claws were actually thorns. The eyes were red. The four realized that this beast was a copy of their fusion. A Shadow Osirisareses. This copy was twisted in the Realm of Nightmares, so were the other two creatures. It shot lava from its arms, like how the four shot ice, it missed, and went into the water, a detonation of steam shot out of the Sound. The Osirisareses flew towards the Shadow Osirisareses. The nightmare fusion hit them with its tail, the four unleashed a shockwave at the shadow, causing it to be sent flying. Inokrezidir shouted over the fighting. “There are too many! Find the Marineers, I’ll hold them.” The four hesitated. “Go now! We are running out of time. Don’t worry about me, you cannot fight all three beasts alone. They’re after you, I’ll be fine.” Inokrezidir shouted. The four dived into the water.
