    <h1>Reptile Man III: Dawn of the Talismans</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
      Jill, Jake, Ryan, Tim, Frank, and Pete landed next to the Gibbon's house, where the rest of the group were. They went over to the door, opened it and went in. Trevor was the first to see them. “Jake? You’re alive?” He asked. “Yes.” Jake answered. It wasn’t long before the others came in the room. “Ino, we found out what Grutwaq is doing.” Ryan said. “He sent an army of his minions to attack us.” Jill said. “How many?” Mr. Gibbons asked. “Twelve Thousand.” Jake answered. “Ah, bring it on! We can take them easy.” Brian said. “These are not the Grutwaq heads.” Jake said. “They are not the only ones I observed in the army, I saw metal things with small knives that fly.” Jill added. “Those must be the robot Cyport’s, mini bots.” Garry said. “There were about twenty of those, and there were other things, there were creatures that were about ten or twelve feet high. They are part of the twelve thousand, so in total there is twelve thousand and twenty characters in that army.” Ryan said. “I will light a distress fire, it is an ancient way of calling for aid.” Ino said already going outside to do it.
      <p>“We have Troy, Makaio, Trevor, Jake, me, Ryan, Brian, Michael, Garry, Ino, Mr. Gibbons, who is wielding the sword of Zat, and five new people, Grower who borrowed a knife, Andrew, who is an extra person that Mallory called, he is wielding an axe and a bow and arrow and two swords, we have Tim, Frank and Pete. Still not enough.” Brandon said. “I want to fight.” Caleb said. “I want to fight, also.” Jill said. “Well...” Brandon said thinking. Soon the rest of the Gibbons's, Mrs. Gibbons Mal, Shealee, and Brianna asked to fight. Teagan was too young, however. “Alright, but one condition, stay in the house. You will be inner defense. If we, on the outside in the fight get beaten, you defend yourselves.” Brandon said. Ino, Makaio, Tim, Jake, Frank, Pete, and some others spent all day building a wall in front of the Gibbon's house. They knew why the army of Grutwaq was coming, so, they wanted to separate the Gibbons from the enemy army as best as they can, they still wanted to fight. Pete gave them bows and quivers full of arrows. “They won’t try to kill them anyway, Grutwaq forbid them to do it. He wants them alive, and as long as they are on the wall, they probably won’t get captured.” Ryan said. Nonetheless, they gave each of them a sword, because if the wall failed they might need them. When the wall was finished, the entire defense force, which was small were running on it preparing for the battle. “So are you scared?” Jake asked. “No.” Tim said. “We are used to battles.” Frank said. “We were in a huge one in the Caribbean, that is where the rest of our family died.” Pete said. “There were pirates who gathered an army and waged war on the island we were on. Our family was in a defense force. When the pirates attacked. They nearly wiped us out, but an allied island came to our aid and defeated the pirate army.” Tim said. “These swords and weapons we have right now are from that island. These are the very same weapons we used in that battle.” Tim said. “So you are confident that we’ll make it through this?” Jake asked. “Well, no. Look at us, Only about twenty versus twelve thousand monster things. The army we faced had five thousand pirates in it, but there is always hope. That is what our parents said, and we will never forget it.” Frank said. Suddenly, a huge rock shot through the air and hit the wall, scaring everyone half to death. The wall was fine, but where did that come from? A thing was moving, it was not alive but was being moved by multiple shapes. It was a catapult. War cries echoed through the neighborhood. Dark shapes were moving toward the wall, thousands of them. In the air were shiny metal things with daggers. It was indeed Grutwaq’s army. The battle of Maple Road, had begun.</p>
