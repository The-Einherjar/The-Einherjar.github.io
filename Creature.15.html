  <h1>The Creature of Ancient Destruction</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 15</h2>
  They opened the door at the dead end of the stairs. There was a huge creature that was looking in the opposite direction out the window, where he could see the battle. He wore a huge cloak. “I have been waiting for you, Gibbons.” He turned around and took his cloak off. “Grutwaq!” Garry declared. “Gost, I remember you. I do not need you, or Inoik this time. You are a traitor and I will destroy you!” Grutwaq said. Gost used the Amphibian Talisman to transform and prepared for the coming assault. Grutwaq shot a purple lightning bolt, Mr. Gibbons got in the way and slashed at the attack with the Sword of Zat. The lightning bolt was sent back at Grutwaq, who roared in pain. “Your battle is with us, Grutwaq.” Mr. Gibbons said. “I am going to enjoy this.” Grutwaq uttered, a giant purple diamond sword was on the wall. Grutwaq grabbed it. “Let me help you.” Garry said, he had the golden sword. Grutwaq attacked, his sword was blocked by both the Sword of Zat and the golden blade.
  <p>The battle was getting more heated up. “Fire at will!” Cody ordered. Jordan Peterson shot fire out of his dragon hands and the arrows caught on fire and hit about two flying reptiles, both fell to the ground.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Gibbons, Brianna, Mallory, Shaley, and Caleb shot arrows at Grutwaq. Jill took flight and slashed her sword at the Creature of Ancient Destruction. Grutwaq started to charge an energy ball. “Prepare to lose.” He said.  Abruptly, the door flew open. “Huh?” Grutwaq asked confused. The four Talisman wielders came in. “You are late.” Jill said. “We meet once again.” Grutwaq declared. “We figured that you would be up here.” Ryan said. “You defeated the hydra who was waiting to obliterate you.” Grutwaq uttered, amused. “It was too easy.” Jake said. “You have not changed. However, that is about to change.” Grutwaq retort. The four Talisman wielders turned into their Talisman forms. Jake shot a plasma blast, Trevor shot ice, Brandon shot a solar blast, and Ryan shot fire. This didn’t seem to do very much, but it distracted Grutwaq long enough for them to fuse into Osirisareses, they then changed into Osirisareses’s upgraded form, they had Talisar. All three blades that were required to defeat Grutwaq were there, now. Grutwaq pointed his sword down at them, and after ten seconds the battle began. Garry leaped on top of Grutwaq’s sword and started to give it cuts, in an attempt to break it. Mr. Gibbons and Osirisareses tried their best to block Grutwaq’s attacks. Grutwaq was trying to destroy them. “I have been waiting for a long time.” Grutwaq laughed, he was pushing his sword down hard against Alan and Osirisareses’s swords. Purple lightning was dancing all over Grutwaq’s sword. Grutwaq was almost at the point of forcing Mr. Gibbons and Osirisareses to the ground, both Talisar and the Sword Of Zat glowed. A flash of orange, green, blue, and silver light lit up and Grutwaq fell because of the force, he shot a purple energy blast. Osirisareses quickly generated an elemental shield around him and Alan and Garry. The shield shattered into energy pieces but Grutwaq’s attack was halted. Grutwaq rose, Osirisareses shot a diamond blast at the creature, who countered with a purple blast, both attacks were stopped by each other. Garry slashed at Grutwaq’s leg. Grutwaq tried to destroy Garry with another purple energy blast. Garry jumped off, the energy blast hit Grutwaq’s leg, he roared out in pain. He glared at Garry. “I will...destroy you!” He roared. Talisar glowed like the sun and Osirisareses stabbed Grutwaq in the back. Mr. Gibbons, then sprinted up Grutwaq’s sword and stabbed a glowing sword of Zat into Grutwaq’s chest. Garry, then ran up toward Grutwaq’s head, the creature grabbed him. “You will now be destroyed!” Grutwaq roared, he raised his sword over Garry. When Grutwaq’s sword came down, Osirisareses and Jill shot fire. Garry quickly blocked Grutwaq’s attack, the gold sword glowed and Garry pushed  Grutwaq’s sword, he then escaped and ran to Grutwaq’s head and stabbed his sword into the Creature of Ancient Destruction. “That was for my family, my old and my new.” Garry said. Golden energy shot across Grutwaq and a golden triangle was created between the three swords. When the light was gone, Grutwaq was like a statue, he cracked and collapsed to the ground in pieces.</p>
  <p>Grutwaq was destroyed and the tower was shaking violently. “I think it is time to get out of here.” Shaley said. “You said it.” Caleb replied. Osirisareses flew them down the fortress.</p>
  <p>Outside, the minions of Grutwaq were panicking. Lightning was hitting Grutwaq’s tower, When the tower was halfway collapsed, Grutwaq’s minions were gone. The remains of the tower then disappeared. 

Gost recited poetry from the Wall of Zat.
</p>
<p>When the vengeful creature of destruction's defeat seems far</p>
<p>There will be war</p>
<p>And when the sword of Gibbons is raised in the air</p>
<p>The creature shall meet it’s scare</p>
<p>The return of Kzat shall be greeted by the sun</p>
<p>Then remains of the creature shall be none</p>
