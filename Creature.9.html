      <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
  Osirisareses took off, the Gibbons were at the ruins of the Cylinder Watchtowers.  There was an entrance that remained, it was unearthed under a rock. They went in, it was dark but the Sword of Zat glowed. There was nothing that seemed to be alive but a few spiders, the Gibbons avoided them, so nothing happened. They journeyed down until some zombie creatures attacked them. The Gibbons were armed with weapons: the Sword of Kzat, Dagger of Zat, the swords, bows, and  knives from the warrior brothers. Some zombies were easy, some were medium, some were hard, but finally they entered the sword piece chamber. The Gibbons grabbed the shard, they had to fight more zombies on their way out. A creature tried to strike with its mace, but it missed. Mr. Gibbons sliced the zombieâ€™s arm. Caleb, Shaley, and Brianna shot arrows. Jill slashed a zombie with her sword. Mallory struck another with the Dagger of Zat. More arrows rained down.
