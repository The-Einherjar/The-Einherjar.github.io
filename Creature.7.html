      <h1>The Creature of Ancient Destruction</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
      Fiery arms erupted out of Ryan’s wings and grabbed Tratwaq’s maces, and threw them elsewhere. Tratwaq took out his sword from his back. “Do you feel dread?” Tratwaq asked. “Yes, I feel dread that this will take long. I  hunger for chow.” Ryan said, he shot a fire stream, which was blocked by Tratwaq’s sword. Tratwaq laughed an evil laugh and leaped at Ryan. “I win!” He claimed. Before he could strike, Ryan grabbed him and tossed him to the ground. Tratwaq’s sword glowed purple shot purple energy bolts at Ryan. “Hey, that hurts! Stop it, you can poke an eye out with that!” Ryan declared, he  took to the air. “Coward! Come back down here!” Tratwaq complained. “Come down and continue to receive torture from you? No way!” Ryan refused. Tratwaq leaped  high into the air, and landed on Ryan’s back and started to slash. Ryan flew faster. Nevertheless, Tratwaq hang on. Ryan surrounded himself with fire. Tratwaq was burned and he fell, the general roared, and fell to the ground, he vanished into fog. Ryan changed back and searched for the others.
      <p>Zrisitis, Min Su, and Garry finished off the last rubber minion. “Where’s Drr?” Ryan asked. “Here!” Growlor said from behind them, he threw a wounded Drr to the ground.  “Captain Ryan, I failed, again..” Drr uttered. “No, your underlings are defeated. You lost.” Jake said. Suddenly, the ground shook. “Something is approaching, from the Nightmare World. What have you wrought?” Zrisitis asked. Growlor couldn’t answer.
“Everyone, change into your most powerful battle forms!” Ryan called. “With pleasure.” Jake said. Jake turned into Reptile Man, Brandon turned into The Lord Of The Oaks, Trevor turned into Fish Master, Ryan turned into Fire Reptile Man, Zrisitis turned into a warrior with wings, and Jake used the sword that Min Su gave him to cover the cement they were on with diamond. Min Su turned into his rock golem form, he absorbed the diamond and became covered with diamond armor. The four Ryan, Jake, Trevor, and Brandon then fused together, and upgraded into the more powerful fusion form. There, in the fog stood two hundred feet high, a terrible creature. It was dark purple, translucent rubber, and had a fifty foot long spiky tail. It’s eyes were red, it had large, ultra strong arms with razor claws, it’s legs were like two gigantic tree roots with claws., it had a vast eight hundred foot wingspan, in it’s mouth were razor fangs, and it had four horns on it’s head that looked like a evil crown. It looked down at it’s eight enemies. “I told you I would come back!” It roared. It was Grutwaq, the creature of ancient destruction.
