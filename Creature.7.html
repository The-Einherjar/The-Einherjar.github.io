      <h1>The Creature of Ancient Destruction</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
      They woke up, they were in the Gibbon’s backyard. “Wha- What happened?” Ryan asked. “You were hurt pretty bad. Stay on the grass, you’ll feel better soon.” A familiar voice said. “Gost.” Jake said. Ryan looked around, none of the Gibbons were in the backyard at the moment. It was the day after Grutwaq came back. It was in the afternoon when finally the Gibbons and others came. “I am glad you guys are feeling better. That was quite a day that you had yesterday.” Mr. Gibbons said. “Yes, just getting back from a quest, then trying to stop bad guys and failed, and ended up fighting the most powerful creature of rubber we have ever faced.” Brandon said. “We heard.” Mr. Gibbons said. “Growlor is trapped in the Nightmare World, he tried to rush us and . Cyport blasted him into the fog. Grutwaq, he is more powerful then he ever was.” Gost said. “The Sword Of Zat isn’t going to be enough. The Wall of Zat states: 
      <p>When shadow comes in the world</p>
      <p>When the Creature of Ancient Destruction is abroad</p>
      <p>The dagger the tablet and the sword will need aid</p>
      <p>One will be the blade of four ancient forged elements</p>
      <p>the final missing piece has four pieces that must be forged together</p>
      <p>one in the cylinder, one in the underground of the great tiles</p>
      <p>one in the labyrinth of the ocean, and one in the frozen land which none have yet made an empire.</p>
      I believe that the dagger and the tablet it speaks of is of course, the dagger, and the tablet that trapped Grutwaq the first two times. The sword is the Sword Of Zat, in addition, we need two other swords. The pieces of a sword are four, the first in “the great tiles”, the forging place of the  Talismans. The second, in “the cylinder”: Ancient Gzatians built watchtowers, the Cylinders. Third, “labyrinth of the ocean”: There is an old Marineer stronghold. The Marineers were allies of Kzat, the stronghold is deserted. The ”frozen land” could be the heights of Mount Baker. The Wall of Zat was inscribed in Zat, hundreds of years before this time. Mount Baker was the northern frontier. We must find the pieces and forge them together, and find the element blade to defeat the Creature Of Ancient Destruction.” Gost explained. “Then we must start immediately!” Brianna said. “How are we going to get there?” Jill asked. “We can handle that.” Trevor said. He turned into Fish Master, Jake turned into Reptile Man, Brandon turned into Lord Of The Oaks, and Ryan turned into Fire Reptile Man. They glowed and fused together into Osirisareses. “Want a lift?” He asked. “I don’t think this is a good idea.” Jill said. “Why?” Min Su asked. “I don’t know if they should be driving.” Jill teased.
