      <h1>Reptile Man III: Dawn of the Talismans</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
      “Three talismans weren’t enough. What kind of creature is Grutwaq anyway?” Ryan asked. “An evil one that has revenge as his goal.” Ino answered. “He said something about a lizard thing. Assuming the lizard thing was Jake, in reptile form, did you face him before?” Trevor asked. “Yes, Grutwaq sucked Garry into a strange jar and said that he wanted revenge against the Gibbons, since their ancestor was the one who first trapped Grutwaq in imprisonment, but somehow Grutwaq escaped that time. After an intense struggle, we managed to trap him again, except Inoik found a way to free him yet again, and it is my guess that they made a deal, that they release Grutwaq and he takes his revenge, crushing us in the process. Then, he will help them take over the world.” Ino said. “Last time, we used the wall of Zat to trap him, so we should do it again.” Mallory said. “The wall of Zat is being guarded and blocked, and Inoik might have sealed it by now.” Ino said. “There must be some other way to destroy him nobody is invincible. What of my dragon transformation?” Jill said. “That was a gift, your ear ring is a Talisman, forged by my people. Your ancestors passed it as an heirloom. The dragon transformation occurs when someone is in great need. Yes, it could smash up Grutwaq, however, it is difficult to transform, it requires a lot of energy.” Ino said.  “Ino.... Is there any possibility in the talismans?” Trevor asked. “Not even the talisman’s secret power can destroy Grutwaq. There might be a way, but you need all four talismans to do it and one is lost.” Ino said. “There is however, one being from Zat who is still alive.” Mr. Gibbons said. He went and quietly walked toward a bush and a creature sprung out . It was small, had two white eyes, and was a pale color with. It was the Crypt, Grower. “Would tell us how to destroy Grutwaq, please?” Mr. Gibbons asked. “The only effective way is the sword of Zat.” Grower said. “Where is it?” Ino asked. “It is asleep not far from here, for this is an ancient battleground. It is sealed in a rock. Not just anyone can wield that blade to destroy the creature of ancient destruction,, you have to be a descendent of the legendary warrior, Gibbons. “You are looking at them.” Mr. Gibbons said. “Alright then, one of you should go walk around the neighborhood. If you walk by it, the spot will glow.” Grower said. “In the meantime, I say three of us should go check out what Grutwaq is doing.” Ino said. “I’ll go.” Jill said. “I will transport you.” Ryan said. “Then it is settled. The council is over, everyone is dismissed. Where is Alex” Trevor asked.
