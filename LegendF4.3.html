      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
   It was lunch. Jaclyn was sitting on stairs, eating her pizza. Her friends were there, they were dreading the test in their math class. Paulius walked near, he was dark blonde; he glanced at Jaclyn and nodded. Cristine walked over as well. She was a 15-year-old, and her hair was dark. “Hi, Jaclyn.” She said.
  <p>In the principal’s office, Jake, and Mr. Schwab were talking. “I suggest we double, no, triple the guard.” The principle said. Jake nodded. “We better summon the creatures.” He said. “Yes.” The principle said. There was a noise. “What?” Mr. Schwab asked. Students screamed. Mr. Schwab and Jake went to see, a figure with claws stood next to the stairs under the glass pyramid which was part of the school. “You!” Mr. Schwab cried. The figure smiled wickedly. “What do you want?” Mr. Schwab asked. “Just four of your students.” The figure said. “No!!” Mr. Schwab roared. Jake took his Talisman and he turned into a lizard-like creature that stood on two. “Impressive.” The figure uttered, he took a wicked sword out of his cloak. Jake climbed a pillar and jumped toward the middle of the glass pyramid and took a sword out. It had a silver hilt, and a green blade. Jake landed on the floor. The figure grinned, he swung his weapon; Jake blocked it with the green sword.</p>
      <p>Three cloaked shapes charged. One took Jaclyn, another, Cristine. The girls screamed. One of the cloaked figures took a black pole, and charged at Paulius, who took a white sword out his backpack, it looked like a claw. He used it to block. The girls were dragged toward the main doors.</p>
      <p>Jake and the figure fought. Paul came; he saw two cloaked guys dragging Cristine and Jaclyn, Paulius in hot pursuit, with another cloaked guy chasing Paulius. Paul ran toward the two cloaked figures, Talisman out. “Not so fast!” He shouted. One of the figures tried to cut Paul’s legs with a dagger. Paul leaped, perfect evasion, too perfect, he fell to the ground. The two made out of the building. Paulius maintained the chase. The figure that was fighting Jake broke from the fight and chased Paulius. Jake and Paul were on the heels of the kidnappers. Outside, Paul turned into an orange dragon with one very large claw. The fight began at a pond near the school. Another guy, Chris entered with a white sword like Paulius. The two cloaked abductors escaped, the other figures distracted. After an amount of time, the figures ran. Paul searched for the two with girls, he failed to find them. “Dang it.” Jake said. Somebody came running. “Am I too late?” He said. Jake had heard the voice in the past. “Jasoner?”</p>
