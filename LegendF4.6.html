      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
What looked like thistles, flew and hit the Gitzons, Jake, Chris, and Paulius looked behind them. There was a tree thing with six arms of thorn vines and roots that were strong enough to keep him up, he also had some cactus thistles, two stinging leaves, and a reptile shaped head with a horn. Brandon, the wielder of the Plant Talisman. There was also a fish, it was blue, with lobster arms, whale fins, a shark dorsal fin with a spine, a swordfish horn on its head, and large fins that kept him flying. Trevor, the wielder of the Aqua Talisman. There was also a teenager in silver armor with a long spear. Trevor shot subzero energy at one of the Lava Dragons, when the dragon froze the other Lava Dragons shot fire streams to melt the ice. The Lava Dragon was no longer trapped, Trevor cringed. “Trevor, we need to fuse.” Brandon suggested. “Good idea.” Trevor said. Brandon and Trevor glowed and swirled around each other, they fused into a big ice figure with two arms and legs; its right arm was shaped like a trunk. He shot a mammoth blast, it froze a dragon, the fusion then hit it with its trunk. Ice broke from the dragon and hit everything except the good guys, who took cover. The Gitzon general charged at the teenager with the spear. The teenager blocked the attack and struck the general. “Let’s go!” Jasoner said.
      <p>They were near the bright light that would take them to Trulaz. Jasoner drew a sword and shouted, “Not so fast!” The figures turned. The leader grinned, he drew his own sword. The two engaged in a duel, it only lasted twenty-five seconds, Jasoner won. The others left the girls and escaped fast. “Thank you!” Jaclyn exclaimed. “Yes.” Cristine said. “Welcome. Thanks Cody, Brandon, and Trevor.” Jake said. “Your welcome.” Cody, the teenager with the spear said. They went outside; there was a chariot with dragon things. Brandon changed into himself, he had brown hair. Trevor changed back, he had red hair. They and the two girls, and Cody went on the chariot. Jasoner changed into a wolf. They went back to the school, when they arrived, they went to the principle.

“We heard them mention “pact”. We think they are going to invade.” Jaclyn said. “I summoned the creatures.” The principle replied. There were underground creatures that lived under four schools, Lynnwood, Mountlake Terrace, Meadowdale, and Edmonds. The creatures became protectors. “We better guard the portal. I’ll send flying chariots.” Cody said. “We better mobilize.” Jake said. “Let’s contact the other schools.” Mr. Schwab ordered. “I want them defeated before they attack our cities. There may be extra caves around the portal, so they might use them to ambush us. Therefore, we shouldn’t fight in there, Gitzons know how to use mountains. We will go to an open field. I don’t know how many Gitzons will attack, so I think we should do it that way. We must protect the city.” Jake said. “What about the army of the empire?” Cristine asked. “We will fortify the field.” Jake said. “What if they don’t approach the field?” Jasoner asked. “We’ll lead them.” Paul answered. “With the flying chariots.” Cody said. “What of the forests?” Cody asked. “The armies of the empire of Trulor are forest creatures, not all, but we shouldn’t.” Jasoner warned. “I agree that a fortified field is the best option.” He said. “What about the military?” Jaclyn said. “There is a high probability that the emperor will be leading, he could defeat your tanks and stuff easy.” Jasoner said. “And the curse of Mons Surprem makes it impossible for the military to spot them.” Gost said walking in. Gost was very wise, he was a teacher. Mons Surprem was a mountain. “We should call the Gibbons.” Jake suggested.
