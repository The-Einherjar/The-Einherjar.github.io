      <h1>Talisman IV</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 7</h2>The sun was setting. It was a red sunset, it matched the canyon’s name perfectly. There was a tower ahead of them. “It’s one of the sorcerer's watchtowers. We better be careful here.” Jasoner said. They went on, when they were next to the tower two strange things with swords and axes and other weapons charged right at them. “Great!” Verderk said. They all drew their weapons and Jasoner turned into his Beta Talisman form and Trejakydon turned into Osirisareses again, they started to fight the attackers. After a few minutes, the fight turned into a run. Jasoner was compelled to turn back into his human form, and Trejackydon lost his dragon form, they were exhausted. They found a place to hide. “Excellent, now we are about to be finished off by some crazy things.” Trejackydon said tired. He suddenly saw a strange egg thing. “What’s this?” He asked. “I don’t know.” Jasoner and Verderk both said without looking at it. Talisar and the Talismans glowed, and the energies from the  swirled around the egg. The egg was the size of a football and looked like it was made out of stone After a few seconds, the egg glowed and cracked open, light shot into the sky and the energy took shape. When the light was gone there was a dragon, a Talisman Dragon like Aroseer. He was about thirteen feet high and  thirty-four feet long. He was sparkly green, and his spikes were diamonds. “I am Rinazor. I have waited for a long time to awaken and finally, I am.” It said. “Can you fight of those strange things and get us out of here?” Trejakydon asked. “Not at the moment, but I can give you energy, so that you can. Two of you have Talismans. Here is my gift to both of you.” Rinazor said. He shot energy from his mouth, it struck all eight of the Talismans and they glowed radiantly. Trejakydon turned into Osirisareses, except this time they looked  different. They had an orange diamond of their forehead, their thorn claws were extended and they turned into green diamond blades, their wings grew bigger, and they sparkled like a diamond, the diamond armor grew stronger, diamond spikes surfaced. Jasoner turned into a tall thirty-foot wolf that stood on two legs and had long arms, and colossal claws. Two spikes with lightning were on its back, its fur was like  glittering dark blue gemstone, this was the fusion of the four Lightning Wolf Talismans and with Rinazor’s energy he became more powerful. His spikes turned into wings with spikes, his tail extended and split in three, two changed into two scorpion tails with lightning dancing. The two titanic Talisman beasts took off into the air and flew toward the tower. A red dragon came out of the tower, atop was the tower’s master, a menacing figure with black armor with spikes on it. He had a long tail and a steel helmet that hid his face. He had a long staff with four razor blades. The dragon had a long metal spear mounted on its front, like a harpoon flying to its prey. On its tail were steel spikes attached to a steel belt thing attached to the steel seat the rider was on. Behind him came out human sized bat things, the two crazy things, and winged giants. The crazy things had enormous fangs and were armored. Osirisareses clawed every bat that came in his path. Jasoner did the same thing except, he also used his scorpion tails, he also shot out lightning bolts. About twenty winged giants flew towards Osirisareses, and fell to the ground after Osirisareses used some short of green diamond energy blast. The master of the tower decided that he could not win so he took all his remaining creatures and retreated. The tower collapsed after a shockwave was sent from Osirisareses. The Talisman colossuses changed back into Trejakydon and Jasoner. “Now we have to do is get to the mountain.” Verderk said. “No problem.” Rinazor said. They all climbed on Rinazor’s back and took off into the air in the direction of the mountain in the distance.
