      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
    The armies of the four schools met near Alderwood Mall. Jake, Cody, and Paul commanded the army of Mountlake Terrace High. Brandon, and a guy named Jordan, commanded Edmonds. Trevor, and a gentleman by the name David, commanded Meadowdale, and Gost commanded Lynnwood. There were 60,000 strong in the virtually empty area, despite it being a mall. Flying chariots arrived. “They are coming, they have the same numbers except, they have armored giants at the front.” One of the creatures made known. Jake mulled it over. “Reform! Big creatures, front.” He said. Big creatures went the front, Zror’s giants came into view. They had an almost zombielike quality, they were gray with steel armor, and they carried axes. Some of them were fifty feet tall, there were about a hundred of them. A horn sounded, the giants charged. “Standby trebuchets!” Gost uttered. “Fire!” The giant catapults loosed huge rocks, some of them caused giants to fall, while most of them just bounced off. The speech from Mr. Gibbons sounded in Jake’s head:
      <p><i>“It is without a doubt that we have a destiny to fight evil, we can run from it, or we could choose to fight evil.”</i></p>
      <p>“For liberty! Charge!” Jake shouted. The bigger creatures charged, Jake, Trevor, Paul, and Brandon also. They turned into the dragon, reptile, fish, and tree thing. Trevor and Brandon fused. Then, three dragons came, Rinazor, Zriqron, and Aroseer. “Ha! You invited respectable guests!” The fusion exclaimed. The dragons shot a firestorm. The big creatures used their spears to stab up at the giants, Paul dived at one and stabbed with his claw. Jake climbed one and stabbed it, then leaped to the next one. Gost changed into a frog creature he had a salamander tail. He also had a talisman, but not one of the four. He leaped and sliced. A youth named Brian turned into a sea serpent, yes, he had a Talisman. Jasoner, who used all four of his Talismans, transformed into a huge wolf that had two scorpion stings on its back, shot lightning. The giants fought with axes.</p>
      <p>Reqror watched. Zror, who had other matters, left him in charge. The general decided to enter the fray, he drew his sword.</p>
