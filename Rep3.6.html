      <h1>Reptile Man III: Dawn of the Talismans</h1>
      <h2>Chaper 6</h2>
      “Here, we are.” Ryan said landing quietly. “Wow, they changed this place quite a bit.” He added. The volcano inside was now huge, and had large stairs leading to the top. They did not land inside, but Ryan flew over it and saw the changes. They looked down into the crater. Grutwaq was there, looking at something proudly. “I can’t see it.” Jill said. Ryan took them to the other end of the crater. There were lots and lots of what appeared to be Grutwaq’s minions, they were tall, had spiked shoulders and carried weapons like swords, spears, axes, and whips. Inoik and Gost came in the room. “That was fast.” Inoik said. “How many are there?” Gost asked. “Twelve thousand.” Grutwaq answered. “What are you going to do with them?” The robot asked. “I’m going to launch an assault.” Grutwaq said. “Better make it quick, my patience is running out.” Inoik said. “Good idea. My minions, attack now and make it quick! By the way, some of the people in that lair must be taken to me for something special I have in store for them, bring them to me alive. Destroy everything else. Now don’t fail me or else you all will wish you were never summoned!” Grutwaq shouted. Grutwaq’s minions rushed for the stairs. “I believe that is the signal to leave.” Ryan said. They took off.
      <p>Gost was anxious, Skull Baron sat down, he was silent. “Destroy everything else?” He uttered. “He is to annihilate them? I mean, I attacked them, but I did not want to “destroy” destroy them.” He said. Skull Baron spoke. “No, you just wanted to shatter them, take the talisman, and leave them broken.” He remarked. Gost stared at him. “You’re right.” He sighed. “Look, you wanted to find your daughter, on the other hand, would your daughter be proud of what we are doing to find her?” The baron asked.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, Jake and the three brothers were making their way to Lynnwood. Suddenly, a huge fire creature landed in front of them. “I need a short rest.” It said. “Hey, what gives?” Pete growled. The fire creature’s tail struck them. Frank released an arrow at the creature. “What?!” The creature thundered. “You attacked us!” Frank said. “I did no such thing.” The creature said, however when he turned, his claws struck the brothers, they took this to be an attack and counter-attacked. The fire creature took this to be an act of aggression. “Well, I could use a little practice.” He said. Jake turned into a Reptile, the fire creature turned quickly and shot a fireball, Jake dodged, he did not see the creature’s face. The creature’s armor blocked the fireball. Jake charged his energy and shot it. The creature was hit by it and was pushed back. Jake to fired little energy balls, and was constantly doing it so he couldn’t see the creature and the creature couldn’t see him. “Come on Ryan, beat these bullies and get us out of here!” A girl on the creature said. “Fine, but first I’ll get rid of their flying artillery that keeps on fire balls, it is starting to hurt a lot.” The creature said. He flew at Jake and shot a stream of fire. Jake activated his shield, which revealed himself. “Jake?” Ryan said in confusion. Jake stopped when he saw that it was Ryan. “Ryan, what are you doing here?” Jake asked. “Jake, is that you?” Jill asked. “Yes, I’m back. By the way Grutwaq is back.” Jake said. “Yes, we know we were spying on him, he just sent twelve thousand things to attack us.” Ryan said. “Okay, let’s go.” Jake said. “The claws, and tail, is that what you judged to be attacks? It was an accident.” Ryan said. Jake turned back into his regular form, and he and the three brothers, though they hesitated, climbed on Ryan’s back and they took off at full speed toward Lynnwood.</p>
