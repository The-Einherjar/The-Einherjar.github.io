      <h1>Talisman IV</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
      The city was gigantic, it was made out of stone, metal and wood. In the center, a blue diamond citadel stood. The city had fifteen sections around the citadel, stone walls surrounded them.  The first wall was diamond shaped with the fifteen sections inside. There were a lot of parks and, lakes throughout the city. The walls were abundant in towers, they each had giant crossbows mounted. The soldiers were clad in blue armor, each warrior had a spear, sword, and axe. Their helms were triangular. There were thousands of archers. They were running towards the front of the city where the sorcerer’s legions were coming, Osirisareses flew in that direction. “How long did it take to build this city?” Osirisareses asked. “About three thousand years. “Centuries, it was young when the king of Trulor first attacked. It  became the capital few years, before.” Jasoner answered. When They all went to the top of the nearest tower, they landed,  Osirissareses let his passengers off. It was foggy outside the city; the first giants came into sight. The soldiers on the towers fired the giant crossbows. Six giant crossbow bolts hit the first giant, others hit the giant next to it. A catapult boulder hit a zombie behind them. “The battle now begins, but I assure you, it will end shortly if I have something to say about it.” Jasoner said, he took his four Talismans and glowed, and turned into his Talisman fusion. The seven rebel soldiers started to fire arrows at incoming giants. The catapult fired another rock, a giant leaped out of the fog and crushed the boulder into pieces with its giant steel mace. “Hammer this!” Osirisareses thundered, he shot a fireball, this was followed by more giant arrows from the crossbows. The giant fell to the ground. Osrisareses continued to attack with fireballs. Some giants started to throw giant spears, but the wall remained standing, for now anyway... A half an hour passed, and forty-five giants were down, more still came. Unfortunately, the sorcerer’s giants brought up some gigantic, and I mean gigantic one-hundred-foot-long, and sixty-foot-tall catapults. They bombarded the wall with fiery volcanic rocks. The first hit the great gate, it exploded open, and was now in pieces. The fire spread inside the city. More and more gigantic boulders of lava and smoke blitzed the city in a raging salvo. The wall’s defenders couldn’t see where the catapults where because of the fog, and the smoke that was building up. Without warning, something started to hit the wall. “To that part of the wall!” Jasoner shouted. Osirisareses grabbed everybody and flew down to the wall that was getting hit by the steel maces. Cracks were everywhere, and small pebbles of stone fell to the ground. “This is it.” Verderk said. The wall burst open and five giants came in, they were instantly attacked. Archers kept on shooting endlessly, causing some of the smaller giants to back away. More parts of the wall were demolished, and over fifty giants were already in the city. Osirisareses struck with Talisar, the blade glowed with Vlfirpotence energy. The sky was nearly red because of the fire.  Jasoner to shot lightning without stopping. Many giants fell to the ground, but more came in. Osirisareses  struck Talisar into the ground, a shockwave of orange energy discharged, all the giants that were in front of Osirisareses were sent flying out of the city, and probably to their defeat. Thousands and thousands of soldiers came to the first section of the city where the battle was, to keep their numbers up. An entire hurricane of arrows were fired at the incoming giants. “We are not going to last, are we?” Osrisareses asked. “We will win and defeat the sorcerer.” Jasoner said, he shot two spheres of red lightning from his scorpion tails, they struck two charging giants.  Osirisareses took to the air and went toward where the enemy army was. There were ranks and legions of thousands of giants. “We must give it all we got.” The dragon said. He took Talisar, it glowed orange, the great dragon put all his energy into it and flew down to the ground with great speed. When he hit the ground, an orange light erupted into the air, an enormous detonation ruptured the ground, it did not hit the city. Osirisareses was out of energy. Trejakydon was out of energy, he laid on the ground without any fighting energy left. The remaining giants fled. The battle was over.
