        <h1>Reptile Man II: Hunt of the Talismans</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    It was the night, the night of the beginning of what they decided to call the Hunt of the Talismans. Jake and made it to the Gibbons’ house. Everyone who was fighting Gost were there. They had four transportation units with them. Mr. Gibbons went over to Jake. “Jake I saw it. Over there.” He said. Jake looked and saw the little round white glowing eyes before they disappeared. Ino came over. “You know that creature?” Mr. Gibbons asked. “Yes, I do he was seen by me when Gibbons, the great warrior and leader of Kzat came. Growerwen was his name. People who know about him now call him Grower.” Ino said. “What is he?” Jill, who came into the conversation asked. “He is a Crypt, a lost one. He is the only survivor of the Crypts of Rorzron.” Ino said. “Rorzron?” Jill asked, “Realm of Fire. The dominion of the ancient Dread Lord Growun, the enemy of Gibbons and Kzat, the one who trapped himself in the Fire Talisman.” Inokrezidir said. “So he was in Growun’s army?” Mr. Gibbons asked. “He was once in the army of twelve thousand in the Battle of Mud Fields, the first battle of the second Barbarian War, the final war of Zat. There were three people: Min Huns, of the Barbarian Territory, Nazelgrot, of The Unknown Territory, and Jakisis, of Kzat. Now, I know this stuff from the book, I have not been there. The three were in a fight. Jakisis and Nazelgrot were attacked by Mins Huns. Jakisis was a captain of the Kzat armed forces. He and his new ally were having some trouble in the fight, so he lit up a signaling fire to request help from General Harrison, of Kzat. Doing so, he attracted something he did not intend, Growun sent an army of Gitons, metal men, and Retzons, insects with drill noses. Jakisis saw this army off a hill before they reached them. Jakisis and Nazelgrot made an alliance with Min Huns. Min Huns mustered an army of one thousand wizard warriors. Minutes later, the first arrow was shot by Nazelgrot. In the battle, they fought things such as: Mud Serpents, who were apart of the mud field, great steel warriors, dragons, but none of them were as difficult as the last enemy all three of them fought at once. This creature was small, but whenever is was destroyed, it came back. It was a Crypt named Grower.” Ino finished. “Interesting, but why is it following us?” Jake asked. “Because, it senses the descendants of the warrior named Gibbons, who defeated Grutwaq are close. It wishes to return to his home, but it needs the Dagger of Zat, which in order to get, he must find the descendants of Gibbons. That is why he is following us, because he knows one of us is the one he is looking for.” Ino answered. “Now, we should review our journey.” Mr. Gibbons suggested. “First we find the Plant Talisman, it is the closest. Ino says it is under a rock in a forest, near the city of Edmonds, so we will head there first, and when we find it, Ino says the Aqua Talisman is underwater next to Edmonds, so we will not have to go very far to get it, and the final taliman, which is the Fire Talisman is the furthest away in the crater of Mount St. Helens, inside the lava dome, it is the most difficult, but once that part is finished, the crisis is over.” Jake said. “Is everybody ready?”
    <p>“Inoik, what is the point of talking to that water you turned black? It is just liquid with dirt in it.” The Skull Baron said. “This is a communication jug, it allows me to talk to one trapped in another dimension.” Inoik said. “Who are you talking to?” Gost asked. “Somebody able to assist us.” Inoik answered. “No, you don’t trust him do you?” The robot, or ancient automaton asked. “Trust him? I do not need to trust him, all I need to do is release him from his prison, and he will do the job, because he wants to anyway.” Inoik said. He continued to talk to the jug. “Tell me, how did you escape last time?” Inoik asked. A voice came out of the jug. “The thing that imprisoned me was the Wall of Zat. In order to get me out, you must use the opposite: The Wall of Rorzron.” It said. “Where shall I find it?” Inoik asked. “In Umios Tretut. Inside the dome of fire, is the ruins of Yumios, the resting place of Growun after he took the Fire Talisman.” The voice vanished. “What is Umios Tretut?” Gost asked. “It is now called Mount St. Helens, my friend. The dome of fire is the lava dome deep under it. The ancient ruins still awaits the arrival of the one who gets the obtains talisman.” Inoik said. “Good, we will get the talisman, and fulfill part of the plot at the same time.” Gost said. “But, what if they get there first?” The machine asked. “That is easy. We will let the dread lord destroy.” Inoik said. “The dread lord?” The Skull Baron asked. “The dread lord is inside the Fire Talisman, he will attack intruders.” Inoik said.</p>
