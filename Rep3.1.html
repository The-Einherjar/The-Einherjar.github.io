      <h1>Reptile Man II: Dawn of the Talismans</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      Growun continued his pursuit. Jake turned around and walked straight toward him. “Jake, what are you doing?” Jill exclaimed. Growun shot a black lightning bolt. it was blocked by Jake’s plasma shield. Growun took off and flew at Jake, but Jake stood his ground ”Keep going, I’ll distract“ He said. He flew up and started to fight Growun. The dread lord clawed Jake’s wings, Jake fell to the floor, he bit Growun’s wings, both of them fell into the pit, except Jake took a grip of a rope that hung over the pit. He slowly slumped down the rope, at the end of the rope was small wooden boat. “Jake, you need jump toward us.” Jill said. Gost was looking at the entire scene. Jake started to climb out, but he remembered his wings were crippled and he nearly fell over, but he managed to back up, but when he did his claws accidentally cut the rope. The boat plummeted into the abyss with Jake in it.  Jake looked down and saw the falling Growun, who shot a shadow bolt bolt at him, it missed. Jake jumped off the boat and shot a plasma fire ball at Growun. The dread lord shot black lightning, Jake got out of the way. Jake then landed on Growun and started to claw him, then he noticed it with reptile sight, the ground, and they were plunging toward it. Jake leaped and endeavored to glide with his damaged wings. Growun vaulted, using shadow lightning, he then glided with his wings. Streams of magma cascaded on three sides. Jake started to absorb energy from the volcanic rivers, soon he felt power unlike he ever felt. He knew he was about to use his talisman’s secret power, that Ino spoke of. A great blast of and white and orange energy erupted from Jake’s mouth, this resulted in a huge explosion which forced Jake to the ground. Growun was struck by the discharge, he vanished in a blaze of fire and fog. Jake changed back into his human form, he collapsed on the ground asleep. He did not even know where he was, or what would happen next.
