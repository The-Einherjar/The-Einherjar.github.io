      <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
      “We are here!” Jasoner declared. Rinazor dropped them off on a high ledge on the mountain. “I will wait for you here.” He said. “Thank you for your assistance.” Jasoner said. “No problem, contact me anytime.” Rinazor replied. “Where are we?” Trejakydon asked. “The Peak of Epoch. This is where the Vlfirpotence resides.” Jasoner  answered.  Suddenly, they heard screeches. “It’s the tower force, they tracked us!” Verderk shouted over the wind. Jason turned into the fusion of his four Talismans and transformed into upgraded form. Verderk drew his sword. “Trejakydon, we’ll distract them. Go into that cave. The Vlfirpotence is somewhere in there.” Jasoner said. “What is the Vlfirpotence?” Trejackydon inquired. Jasoner was fighting, Trejakydon raced  into the cave. “I am primed for battle now. My tail and claws some stretching after all those years in the egg, so count me in!” Rinazor said.
      <p>Trejakydon was getting lost, then he reached  a tone with a crack in it.  The opening’s outline gave the impression of a sword pedestal. He stuck his sword into the hole, a bright flash lit up, the energy went into the blade. Trejakydon drew the sword and orange energy swirled around him and the Talisar. Trejakydon then changed into Osirisareses and upgraded  to the enhanced form. He then shot towards the cave entrance and erupted to face dozens of human sized bats. The bats flew at him, Osirisareses swung Talisar, a wave of orange energy discharged from it and hit  the bats, all of them fell to the ground. They then flew  towards face the menacing tower master. The dragon shot flames, Osirsareses dodged it. The commandant charged with his dragon, the spear pointed toward Osirisareses. The great dragon generated a potent energy shield with the Vlfirpotence. The force of the shield was so great that the dragon’s spear broke into five pieces. The knight hit with his staff, but it didn’t do very much. Orange lightning charged around Talisar, and Osirisareses struck with it. The dragon and the knight plummeted toward the foundation of the mountain. “Excellent battle, I never thought we would meet. However, it seems that we have.” A voice said, it was a crimson figure that was behind them. “It’s Dritorexaris, one of the sorcerer’s generals!” Jasoner said. “Yes, and his most deadly. I am afraid that even with your new power, that you  are not familiar with yet, you cannot defeat me. Your quest ends here!” The figure laughed.</p>
