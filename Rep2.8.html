        <h1>Reptile Man II: Hunt of the Talismans</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
      Mount St. Helens, the mountain of ash, the place where the last talisman was. They were inside the giant crater, and headed toward the lava dome. “The talisman is inside the lava dome?” Michael asked. “It is under it. There is a secret tunnel in the dome that leads to the ancient tomb of Growun. It is an extremely dangerous place. Pits with lava, with bridges as the only way to cross, Stouses humanlike spiders, and the dread lord himself. There is also a pit with black fog in it called, Yuguzalut, anybody who goes in never comes out. If we don’t obtain the Fire Talisman, then the dark despot will unleash the talisman on the world. He has been preparing his assault. Until now, I couldn’t liberate the Fire Talisman, but now the Reptile, Plant, and Aqua Talismans have been retrieved, and I have all of you as allies and friends.” Ino said. They reached the dome, Ino led them into a hole on its side, he then led them down a hole. When they got under, there was a huge room filled with walls with writing on them, and pits filled with lava. “The great cave of Umios Tretut.” Ino said. “Somebody should write a book about this place.” Troy said. “There is already writing about it.” Ino said. “Where?” Troy asked. “In ancient scrolls, I have some at home. I could show you them, sometime. Not that you’ll be able to read the writing.” Ino answered. “The talisman could be anywhere.” Brandon said. “I don’t see any dangerous creatures.” Makaio said. Right after he said that there was screeching. “What was that?” Ryan asked. “That!” Jill answered, pointing to a large red lizard with wings. On top of it were ten humanlike spiders. “Stouses on a Lava Dragon!” Ino yelled. Jake turned into Reptile Man, Trevor turned into the new form he called Fish Master, and Brandon turned into what he called Lord of the Oaks. Brandon unleashed thistle spikes from his arms, downing three Stouses. Jake flew up and dived at the Stouses, this caused five Stouses to fall. The Lava Dragon began to shoot fire at Jake, he attacked back with a plasma blast. Trevor floated next to the dragon and unleashed an ice blizzard, the cold hardened the lava, and the dragon fell in the lava. Before anyone could relax, there was a great roar. A giant creature stepped out of the shadows, it had a dragon head, arms covered with fire, a great long whip like tail, two giant fire wings, two great legs with lava leaking out of them, and his torso constituted red and orange diamonds, and you were able to see through them into the beast’s heart, which was a great sphere of fire. “Well, we found the talisman. That is Growun in the form of the Fire Talisman beast.” Ino said. The dread lord roared, causing the place to shake. “Ryan, that talisman as I was told by Ino, is yours.” Jake said staring. Ryan stared also. “I shall call it Fire Reptile Man.” He said. “Thanks for naming it after mine.” Jake said. “Jake, Brandon, Trevor you three can take him together. The Fire Talisman is the most powerful of the four.” Ino warned. “We will.” Trevor said. “Bring it on!” Jake said. “That’s the spirit, Jake!” Jill said. “Wait a minute! What are the rest of us who have weapons going to do?” Alex asked. Suddenly, Stouses came charging at them. Everyone except for Jake, Trevor and Brandon that had weapons charged at the incoming Stouses. Growun roared and took another step toward the three talisman guardians. Brandon shot some thistles at Growun. When they hit him they were burnt. “Ah… Brandon, just to remind you fire burns plants, so try not to get too close.” Trevor said as he shot an icicle form his mouth. However, it melted. “Aw, we’re talking extreme heat eh? Well, I have some heat of my own!” Jake bellowed as a fire ball erupted from his mouth. The impact caused Growun to back away a little. Growun shot a blast of fire but missed, he took flight. Trevor flew after him, Jake unfolded his flying lizard wings and took off also. Brandon, who was unable to fly, started to charge up a solar heat beam and shouted out. “That’s right! Get him down here so he can see what sunburns can do!” “That can be arranged.” Jake said. Growun continued to ascend. “Jake, slow him down! I can’t catch up to him!” Trevor said. “With pleasure.” Jake said. He shot ten small fire balls, they hit Growun, causing him to slow down. Growun stopped in midair and glared down at Jake. Jake looked down toward Brandon. “Keep charging! The delivery will be made, we are having trouble with the oven.” He said. “Jake! He’s behind you!” Jill cried. Growun flew down next to Jake, and slammed his fiery tail at him. Jake was sent flying back toward a stone wall. Trevor opened his mouth wide and charged an ice beam. He waited until it melted, and then unleashed it as a blast of water. Growun fell to the ground, he was weakened but not defeated. Brandon shot his charged up solar blast, the beam hit the diamond covered chest with tremendous force, the diamonds reflected it right back at Brandon, but luckily Jake got there in time and blocked it with an energy shield. Growun raised his arms, and two fiery hands burst out of the wings and blasted Jake and Trevor. Jake camouflaged and flew behind Growun. Trevor and Brandon continued firing ice and solar blasts at Growun. Jake turned visible again and shot a spiral beam, Growun was nailed in the back and fell to the ground. After that, all the Stouses were defeated. Growun glowed and the huge fire creature separated into two. One, was Growun, in his original form which was a shadow figure with two black wings and large claws. The other separated thing was a round stone with an image of a flame carved on it, the Fire Talisman. Ryan ran over and grabbed it. Growun got up, angry. Ryan transformed into the fiery creature that Jake, Brandon and Trevor defeated, the form that Ryan called Fire Reptile Man. Growun charged a black energy ball, Ryan blocked, and tried to hit Growun with his fiery arm. Jake shot energy, Growun generated a black energy barrier. “Follow me!” Ino said, everyone followed him. Growun went after them. After a minute, in front of them was a pit with black fog coming out of it, the Pit of Yugazalat. “Why did we come over here?” Troy asked. “Because there is a secret exit that Growun can’t go through.’ Ino said. Ino lead them up some stairs. 
    <p>Meanwhile, at the same time, thirty feet above them were Gost and his colleagues. They found a wall with ancient writings. ‘The Wall of Rorzron.” Gost said. The robot looked down from the level they were on. “Master.” He said. “What?” Gost inquired. The robot pointed down.</p>
    <p>Growun continued his pursuit. Jake turned around and walked straight toward him. “Jake, what are you doing?” Jill exclaimed. Growun shot a black lightning bolt. it was blocked by Jake’s plasma shield. Growun took off and flew at Jake, but Jake stood his ground ”Keep going, I’ll distract“ He said. He flew up and started to fight Growun. The dread lord clawed Jake’s wings, Jake fell to the floor, he bit Growun’s wings, both of them fell into the pit, except Jake took a grip of a rope that hung over the pit. He slowly slumped down the rope, at the end of the rope was small wooden boat. “Jake, you need jump toward us.” Jill said. Gost was looking at the entire scene. Jake started to climb out, but he remembered his wings were crippled, and he nearly fell over, but he managed to back up, but when he did his claws accidentally cut the rope. The boat plummeted into the abyss with Jake in it. Jill suddenly glowed, she transformed into the white diamond dragon. She dived in the pit. Everybody stared at the pit with sixty seconds of silence. Jill appeared out of the pit. She changed back. “I couldn’t find Jake. The pit is deep and murky, it’s impossible to see. I tried...“ She cried. “Growun, the ancient evil enemy of Kzat, is at last gone. But Jake…is…gone also.” Ino said. “Gone?” Garry asked. “Everything alive, that goes into that pit is never seen again, Jill is fortunate to have escaped.” Ino said. “So, now there only are three talismans.” Makaio said. Suddenly the same old man who gave the Reptile Talisman to Jake appeared. “Hello, I am Inezet. Jill, you seen me before. Ino. So, we finally meet uncle.” He said. “Yes, but I am not you’re only uncle. Inoik has been set free. He is trying to remove us from his way of gaining dominion of this earth.” Ino said. “Yes, I know. I have come to warn you: A greater evil is about to enter the conflict. It is aimed at all of you. Bye, my friends we’ll meet again, beware of the evil.” Inezet said as he vanished in thin air.</p>
    <p>Gost stood where he was looking shocked. He looked at the roaring smoke from the pit. “Master, the wall is loaded.” The robot said. “Good, we are almost at our goal.”  He said. The talisman hunters returned to their cars with dozens of thoughts in their minds. Three talisman bearers, one loss, enemies and the world at stake.</p>
