      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 33</h2>
      “Are you alright, Jasoner?” Jake asked. Jasoner was on the ground. “Yes, but now, you must fight Zror. You are the legendary heroes. Win this.” Jasoner said. The Four Talisman wielders transformed. A figure approached, it was Zror, his cloak was on, his sword ready. He laughed without opening his mouth, and discharged lightning, Jake formed an energy shield. Ryan shot fireballs, Zror blocked with his own shield. The emperor, then shot red energy, it struck Brandon. Trevor shot a blizzard, the emperor slashed at the snowstorm. Zror shot a red energy beam with red lightning, Brandon’s horn glowed and absorbed the red energy, he fired it back at Zror. Jake clawed the emperor, who was hit by the red energy. Ryan launched a fire tornado, Zror roared. Trevor shot an ice blast, it froze the emperor, Jake hit Zror with his tail, the ice broke. Zror swung his blade, Jake used his claws to block. Trevor released a white orb, and Brandon discharged a green ray with yellow lighting, Zror was struck, he was sent flying. Jaclyn, Cristine, Paulius, and Chris came. They clashed their blades with the emperor, he laughed without opening his mouth. Jaclyn quickly swung her blade, Zror roared, he fell to his knees, glared at the eight, then collapsed. Ryan took the silver sword. ”Hmm…” He said, Talisar glowed orange in his grasp. Ryan struck the silver blade with the Vlfirpotence. The sword of Growun shattered..
      <p>The Nightmare soldiers disappeared into gray mist. “What?!”  Reqror shouted. “Reform!” He ordered, Zror’s forces reorganized. </p>
      <p>“We have the advantage.” Mr. Gibbons said. ”Initiate encirclement!” Gost directed. The alliance commenced to surround Zror’s army. The four founders and Talisman wielders arrived with a drained Jasoner. “Zror is finished.” Jake announced. Gost nodded. ”Will they surrender?” Cody asked. ”Send the message.” Gost said.</p>
      <p>“The emperor has fallen; they invite us to capitulate.” Reqror’s lieutenant stated. ”They do, do they?” Reqror responded, defiantly. “General..?” The lieutenant asked. ”Prepare to..” Then, it happened, there was a crack, the ice ruptured, Reqror, the Fire, Stouses, Gitzons, Marrzrons, the In Ar, and forces of Trulor plummeted into the fissure. The alliance moved away from the breaking ground. Jaclyn, Cristine, Paulius, Chris, and the Gibbons children hitched a ride on Ryan’s back. Jake, Trevor,  Jasoner, and Brandon turned back into humans, and also hitched a ride. The alliance went back to Lynnwood High. The armies of the republic, and Luris Coldor went through the portal. The emperor's army had vanished..</p>
