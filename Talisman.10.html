      <h1>Talisman IV</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
     The fusion separated in two, Osirisareses was going to take care of this one. “So, we meet for the absolute last time.” Grutwaq said with an evil laugh. “We hope it is the last time.” Osirisareses said. Grutwaq glared, his eyes turned red and he held his axe up. Osirisareses got out of the way before Grutwaq’s axe hit him. The giant dragon shot a fireball at Grutwaq’s head. The evil creature of destruction shot a purple energy ball from his hand, Osirisareses was hit and he fell to the ground. “Perhaps you haven’t increased in power as much as I thought.” Grutwaq said. “As much as you thought? Just how did you come back?” Osirisareses asked. “The sorcerer crafted me a form. It is a hollow shell. I am not exactly as powerful as I could have been, but I am powerful enough to destroy you. That will have to suffice.” Grutwaq sneered. Osirisareses took Talisar and stabbed it into the ground. The two giant creatures circled each other for a minute or two, waiting for someone to attack first. Grutwaq charged and slashed with his claws, the great dragon used his tail as in response. The dragon then flew into the air. Grutwaq shot a purple energy bolt, the dragon generated an elemental shield to block. “You are getting on my nerves.” Grutwaq roared. “Is that supposed to be a surprise?” Osirisareses asked. “Not really.” Grutwaq answered, he fired another purple energy bolt. The great dragon flew out of the way, the energy bolt turned around and hit Osirisareses. The dragon turned toward Grutwaq and fired a giant ice blast from his arms. Grutwaq quickly moved out of the way and shot a purple energy ball that hit and caused Osirisareses to plunge to the ground. Grutwaq took this chance to charge, but the dragon was ready for this, and countered with his thorn claws. He then leaped up in the air and hit Grutwaq with his tail. Purple lightning shot from Grutwaq’s spines and the dragon fell to the ground again but was still not beaten. Grutwaq started to hit Osirisareses with his axe, but this didn’t last long because the great dragon unleashed a shockwave. Grutwaq was forced back and was then bombarded by fireballs. Grutwaq’s axe ignited with dark purple energy. He struck the axe in the ground, rocks flew everywhere. The rocks slammed into Osirisareses. The dragon sent a fire stream at the evil creature, Grutwaq now was barely able to get up “It’s over Grutwaq, you are about one fire blast from being defeated” Osirisareses said. Grutwaq laughed. “Do you think you could actually destroy me entirely? Think for a moment: First time I was defeated was when Gibbons trapped me in that prison, I escaped. Second time, I was trapped again by another Gibbons, I escaped. Third time, the same Gibbons struck with the Sword of Zat, I once again standing. You can never defeat me and expect me to stay defeated. You may have won again this time, but our game has not ended.” Grutwaq declared, he charged his ax with energy to attack. Osirisareses shot a fire stream…
