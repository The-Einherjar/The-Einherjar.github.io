      <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
      <p>All of them went into the mall Suddenly a hole broke in the ceiling and Grutwaq fell in. Jake turned into his Talisman form. There were punches between Jake and Grutwaq. Jake clamped his killer jaws around Grutwaq’. Grutwaq punched him, Jake backed away. Grutwaq shot a  beam. It burned  Jake . Jake got m he zoomed toward Grutwaq and slammed into him . Grutwaq was sent flying.  Jake leaped on him and started pounding all over him. It continued until Grutwaq escaped. “Reptile Man I must depart.” With that Grutwaq teleported Mr. and Mrs. Gibbons came into the section of the mall. “I told them all about it Jake.” Mallory said. </p>
      <p> All of them went home. For the rest of the day Jake fell asleep.</p>
      <p>He found himself in the crater of a volcano. “Who’s There?” Something said. It was six feet tall, had insect like wings, had sharp thorns around his body, and had a centipede like head. “Who are you?” It asked. Jake turned into his Talisman form. “You?” It said bowing. “I’m Ino.” It said introducing itself. “I’m one of the servants of Bamtuo.” It added. “What?” Jake said. “It is an ancient monument. Built for the four guardians of the earth Aqua, Reptile, Fire, and Plant.” Ino explained. “You have the talisman of Reptile giving you the power of the Reptile guardian. But there are more talismans.” Ino said. “What about Grutwaq?” Jake asked. “I don’t know that much about him for he is not of this world.” Ino said. “Then what is he.” Jake said.  “Well he is an evil being. He wreaked havoc on the universe until a great warrior with the name Gibbons trapped him in a seal but somehow he broke it. Another thing is that he ran away to gather his minions.” Ino said. “So, if I’m a guardian how come I can’t hurt him at all?” Jake asked. “Destroying him is not a part of the guardian destiny, I mean him escaping was not even supposed to happen. Now destinies have collided things get odd  when that happens. Only the Gibbons can somehow seal him again, but he will just brake out again. But there might be a way you can eliminate him. You have not used all your abilities now  I cannot tell you what it is but it might be powerful enough I shall help you later and here is a clue to your missing power  good luck farewell.” Jake woke up</p>
      All of them met in the park like they said. “We are going to Mount Baker.” Jake said. “A volcano? ” Mr. Gibbons said.  “Yes. Mount Baker here we come!” Caleb said.
