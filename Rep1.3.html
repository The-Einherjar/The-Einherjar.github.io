      <h1>Reptile Man</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
      <p>All of them went into the mall. Suddenly, a hole broke in the ceiling, Grutwaq fell in. Jake turned into his Talisman form. There were punches between Jake and Grutwaq. Jake clamped his jaws around Grutwaq, the rubber menace punched him. Jake backed away. Grutwaq shot a purple beam, it burned Jake. Jake zoomed towards Grutwaq and slammed into him, Grutwaq was sent flying. Jake leaped on him and started pounding, it continued until Grutwaq escaped. “Reptile Man, I must depart.” With that, Grutwaq teleported. Mr. and Mrs. Gibbons came into the section of the mall. “I told them all about it Jake.” Mallory said. </p>
      <p> The Gibbons went to a friend's house. For the rest of the day, Jake fell asleep.</p>
      <p>He found himself in the crater of a volcano. “Who’s There?” Something requested. It was six feet tall, had insect like wings, had sharp thorns around his body, and had a centipede like head. “Who are you?” It asked. Jake turned into his Talisman form. “You?” It said, astonished. “I’m Ino.” It said introducing itself. “I am one of the servants of Bamtuo.” It added. “What?” Jake asked. “It is an ancient monument, built for the four guardians, Aqua, Reptile, Fire, and Plant.” Ino explained. “You have the talisman of Reptile, giving you the power of the Reptile guardian, but there are more talismans.” Ino said. “What about Grutwaq?” Jake asked. “I don’t know that much about him, for he is not of this world.” Ino said. “Then, what is he?” Jake queried. “He is an evil being. He wreaked havoc on the universe until a great warrior with the name Gibbons trapped him in a seal, but somehow he broke it. Another thing, is that he ran away to gather his minions.” Ino said. “How come I can’t hurt him at all?” Jake asked. “Destroying him is not a part of the guardian destiny, I mean, him escaping was not even supposed to happen. Now destinies have collided, things get odd when that happens. Only the Gibbons, can somehow seal him again, you must protect them. You have not used all your abilities. I shall help you, farewell.” Jake woke up</p>
      All of them met in the park, like they said. “We are going to Mount Baker.” Jake said. “A volcano? ” Mr. Gibbons said.  “Yes. Mount Baker here we come!” Caleb said.
