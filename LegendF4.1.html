      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
     Jaclyn ran to her friends. “Wait!” she said. “Hi.” One of her friends replied. They talked,  while they went to class.
      <p>The principle was sitting down, thinking. He was not content. He saw someone at a store who asked him about his school. On his chair, the principle sat, contemplating that meeting. He did not trust the guy. He typed a message. The message was about a mission, he sent it to a student.</p>
      <p>Paul was tossing his new item, it was a flat round rock, with a dragon carved on one side. Paul was tall, with blonde hair. He was around 16. Jake was at a computer next him, he was short with brown hair, around 19. Jake was checking e-mail, when he saw it. The message from the principle.</p>
      <p><i> Jake, I need help. There was a man at a store. He asked about school hours, lunch times, and security measures. I wanted to call the cops, but something about him was…well out of normal. He had a dark cloak, and… claws. Jake, security has always been one of my top concerns. Jake, can you help?</i></p>
      <p>-Mr. Schwab</p>
      <p>The fact was that thousands of years ago, creatures called Insters saw an evil approaching, so to counter it: four objects were made. Talismans. One for fire, one for aqua, one for plant, and one for reptile. Thousands of years later, they were given to four young people to protect the world. Jake had one of the Talismans, the Reptile. Paul had a minor Talisman called the Dragon, which was not one of the four. Jake logged off.</p>
