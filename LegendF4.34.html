      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 34</h2>
      Jaclyn, Cristine, Paulius, Chris, Ryan, Jake, Trevor, Jasoner, and Brandon were surrounded by trees. The entrance to Trulaz was on the ground. “Legendary heroes, four founders, farewell. You have saved two worlds. Thank you for your assistance.” Jasoner said. “Thanks for your help.” Chris replied. “Here is your blade.” Jasoner said, he stuck Talisar in a tree trunk. “Jasoner, you searched for us, you fought alongside us, you, with us, defeated the Sorcerer, you discovered his weakness. You refer to us as the legendary heroes, but you are a legendary hero.” Jake said. “Perhaps we’ll all meet again. Farewell, my friends.” Jasoner entered the energy. ”Goodbye, Jasoner!” Jaclyn exclaimed.
    <p>Ryan, Jake, Trevor, and Brandon were at Mountlake Terrace High. “I am a senior, that means I’m out of school in June. Paul, you’re the captain now.” Jake said. “I shall do my best.” Paul replied. Jake saw Jaclyn, Cristine, Paulius, and Chris, he nodded, they nodded back. Mr. Gibbons came. “Hey, by the way, can you come to California when it’s July?” He asked. “There’s an ancient city underground.” He revealed. “Sounds like another quest.” Jake said.</p>
