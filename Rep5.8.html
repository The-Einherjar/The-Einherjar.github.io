    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
    The sky darkened, fog  engulfed the mountain. “It has commenced.” Ino said. “What has instigated?” Mr. Gibbons asked. “It looks as if the plague is sweeping the globe.” Gost responded. “Yes, Zarakqua originated from the Nightmare World, it is transforming the earth into another nightmare realm. A domain of fear.” Ino said. “Is there a way to stop it?” Brandon asked. “Vanquish it.” Ino declared. The Moltezron that saved Jill got up, the others were unconscious. It roared. Zarakqua unleashed hundreds of human sized plague creatures. “We’ll fight the monsters, you go thwart Zarakqua.” Gost said, he transformed. Jill got up with her sword. Mr. Gibbons had the Sword of Zat, the others grasped their weapons. “I told you we would battle it, together.” Jill smiled weakly. Jake transformed, he absorbed energy from the Reptile Talisman, Ryan, Brandon, and Trevor transformed and released fire, solar, and ice energy, Jake absorbed it. He emitted white and orange energy to Jill, she was invigorated. “Thanks, but you didn’t need to do that, your energy has reduced, and you’re fighting Zarakqua.” She said. “Like you said, we’re battling it, together.” Ryan replied. The four fused into Osirisareses. They waited, the plague creatures attacked. Osirisareses, Aroseer, and the Moltezron rushed through, attacking them, they shot towards Zarakqua.
