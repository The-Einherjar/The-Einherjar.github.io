    <h1>Reptile Man V: The Destiny of The Talismans</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    “Zarakqua took the talismans?” Garry exclaimed. “It is not over, as long as we are here to stand up, we can confront it.”  Troy said. Suddenly, a piece of the cloud that was blasted from the plague  went crazy, it glowed. “What is this?”  Caleb asked. It grew and took shape, it then stopped glowing. Its shape was exactly like Reptile Man, except it was dark gray. “What’s that?” Shealee asked. The gray figure leapt at Garry, Ino shielded Garry with his claws. The reptile clawed at Ino, and sent the Inster to the wall. Brandon and Trevor went into action with their old powers, Trevor tried to hold the thing down with his gravity beams, and Brandon shot energy spheres. The door opened, it was Alex, who came because he heard of the fight at Alderwood Mall. He ran over and punched the reptile. Suddenly, the thing shot a black blast, knocking Brandon, Trevor, Ino, and Alex to the ground. Jake felt a strong power in him, next thing he knew, he somehow turned into Reptile Man. He tackled the reptile. Garry knocked a laser arrow and aimed. The thing  stopped attacking, Jake turned back to his normal self. “What happened there?” Mallory asked. “I don’t know, let’s not collect any more plague fragments.” Trevor said. The  reptile slumbered. When we attacked the plague  with the radiance beam, it must have somehow merged talisman energy with into that little fragment, forming a half plague, half talisman form.” Ryan said. “How did you turn into Reptile Man?” Jill asked. “I do not know.” Jake said.
