    <h1>Reptile Man III: Dawn of the Talismans</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    They were running, all three of them “Faster, Brandon!” Ryan said. “Are all of them attacking?” Brandon asked. “Sadly, yes.” Ryan replied. “Better do it now, before anybody sees us.” Brandon said. “Agreed.” Trevor nodded. Each of them clenched something in their hands. A flash lit the street and in their place were three creatures: Lord of the Oaks, Fish Master, and Fire Reptile Man.
      <p>Skull Baron set the torches in his flying machine. Gost was waiting. “Why the torches?” He asked. “Inoik requires them to release the creature.” Skull Baron answered. “I know why he needs them.” Gost articulated. “But, why this? I am not a thief, all I wanted was my daughter.” He said. The baron didn’t respond for a moment.</p>
      <p>“There, they are!” Ryan shouted pointing. The three charged. “Great, just great! Right when I thought there would be no trouble!” Inoik roared, he shot two black lightning bolts from his claws. Ryan dodged and sent a fireball in response. Skull Baron got into his jet, and fired lasers. Gost used his talisman, and the robot leaped at Brandon. Before you knew it, a huge battle was fought in the parking lot, fireballs, ice blasts, missiles, acid, thorns, beams, lightning. Brian, Alex, Garry and Ino finally came to the scene. The robot was still not showing any signs of damage. “What kind of a robot is that anyway?” Brian asked. “Looks like titanium to me.” Garry said. Gost leaped into the aircraft. “Inoik, Cyport!” He called. The robot, and Inoik flew to the flying machine, and they took off. “Go after them find out where they’re going.” Ino told Ryan. Ryan flew after them.</p>
      <p>Mount Baker</p>
      <p>“Finally, I could summon the power that could demolish them.” Inoik said. Ryan hid under the snow. “What is this power?” Gost asked. “A power unlike any other. He’ll agree to help us since his enemies are our enemies.” Inoik laughed. Ryan burst out of the snow and flew off. “It looks like we’re going to have company.” Inoik said.</p>
      <p>The others were sitting on the Canva's balcony when Ryan finally arrived. “Ino, they went to Mount Baker. Inoik was saying something about summoning a power that wants revenge what is he talking about?” Ryan asked. “Ryan, where did you say they went?” Ino asked. “Mount Baker.” Ryan replied. “Great Scott.” Ino said. Garry came out. “Garry, they are trying to release him.” Ino said. “Man, our week, keeps on getting better and better.” Garry said. “What?” Ryan asked. “We must depart to Mount Baker at once. There will be time to talk on the way.” Ino said.</p>
