    <h1>Reptile Man III: Dawn of the Talismans</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
      The host of Alex stopped at the front of the mountain. There were about twenty thousand, including Jake, Ryan, Trevor, Brandon, Alex, and the others. “They are here somewhere, I could sense them.” Grower said. “let’s come up with an assault plan.” Alex suggested. “What’s wrong?” Ino asked Trevor, who looked worried. “Ino, do you have a feeling that something is following us?” Trevor asked. “We should attack now.” Frank said. “No, minions are still in there. We need an emergency procedure.” Brandon replied. “I am worried about minions, something big draws near, and it does not feel very promising.” Frank said. “How about you try to charge into the fortress while Trevor, Brandon, Jake and I go into Grutwaq’s lair, and rescue the Gibbons unnoticed?” Ryan asked. “You mean a distraction?” Alex asked. “Yes.” Ryan said. “Then what?” Brandon asked. “Only the Gibbons can destroy Grutwaq, and when they are free they will be able to.” Alex answered. “If Grutwaq is destroyed his army will fall but if he imprisons the Gibbons…” Ino said. “ “We are ready.” Ryan pronounced. “Now.” Alex said, one of his soldiers blew a horn. The army started toward the mountain, pointing their spears forward. “Go, the time is now!” Alex declared when the first minions came out. Jake, Ryan, Trevor and Brandon followed Grower and made their way to Grutwaq’s lair. Alex’s army halted when they came to the great door, there were two other doors near it, they all opened and large numbers of Grutwaq’s minions came out. More and more came. The large minion, the very same one that captured the Gibbons was in front, , he held a large axe with the jar of Grutwaq carved on it. A minion blew a horn. The large minion spoke a different language, but it was certain he said “charge”, because Grutwaq’s army charged. Alex’s front soldiers took out bows and shot arrows at the incoming minion ranks. Soon, the two armies collided, and the battle began while the others were inside the tunnel that led to Grutwaq’s lair. 
    <p>“Their resistance is disappointing, they will never make it past my massive forces.” Grutwaq said proudly. “Well, just so no time is wasted I will finish you off right now.” He added. Suddenly, the door sprang open. “What?” Grutwaq said to himself confused. There right at the back of the door were the four talisman guardians. “You! So, you come to stop me with four people who can turn into walking wood, a chameleon , a beach crab, and an overcooked rooster? Prepare to be finished off for once and for all!” Grutwaq roared. Jake, Ryan. Brandon and Trevor activated their talismans and turned into their talisman forms. Grutwaq was the first to attack, he shot out a beam of energy which missed. Jake turned invisible, Grutwaq slammed his hammer tail on him. Brandon shot a solar beam, it just bounced off. Ryan shot a fire stream. This did not do what Ryan wanted it to do however, Grutwaq turned around and punched him. Grutwaq felt a sharp pinch on his tail. Jake and Trevor were behind him with their jaws locked on. Brandon then tied Grutwaq to the ground with his thorns. Ryan shot a fireball at Grutwaq’s face. Grutwaq roared and broke out of the grasp he was in. He started to shoot energy bolts at them. Jake shot a fireball, which was not enough, he and Trevor then combined their attacks, Trevor shot an ice blast and Jake shot a plasma blast. The two attacks combined together and froze Grutwaq. The Rubber Plutonian broke out. The Gibbons were being helped by Grower, who was secretly trying to release them from the rope. Trevor shot a white ball, which was his secret move. Grutwaq fell to the ground. Brandon the used his secret beam, which caused to Grutwaq roar. This was followed by Ryan firing a gold and silver flame tornado which singed Grutwaq. Jake then absorbed the lava that was around them and shot white and orange energy. Grutwaq was blasted toward the wall, he got up, angrier than ever. He charged up a purple fireball and shot it before the four launched subsequent attacks. The fireball spilt into four pieces and struck each of the talisman guardians. This attack was the most powerful one that Grutwaq used on them so far, they collapsed to the ground. “Grower hurry please.” Mrs. Gibbons said. Grutwaq laughed. He struck each of them with his four tails. “Reptile Man, I was always only after the Gibbons, but you still interfered. The last battle in this very crater was the one that trapped me for the second time. You and that Inster distracted me.” Grutwaq stroke as hard as he can on Brandon, Ryan and Trevor who were already seriously hurt. “If it was not for you, my revenge would be over by now. If I ever wanted revenge on what you have done, I guess this is it. You all will die in vain, knowing that I won.” Grutwaq continued. “Now, you will watch as I imprison the Gibbons!” He said taking out his jar, it glowed. Grutwaq laughed. Unexpectedly, Inoik grow up to the size of Grutwaq, who was still laughing. He then walked toward Grutwaq and used his claw to hit the jar, causing it to fly toward the lava pit. The jar hit the mountain wall and dropped into the lava, it sank and melted. Grutwaq roared in rage. Inoik turned to the Gibbons. “You were right.“ He stated. “Tell Ino good bye for me, and that I am sorry.” He said. Grutwaq turned toward him with rage, he held his claws out and fired a huge purple beam out of them. The beam hit Inoik with full force, he dissolved in the flash. “Inoik?” Gost said silently. His mind flashed of everything that had happened to him, his rage faded, and he thought of his daughter, he transformed into his amphibian form. “You betray me too?” Grutwaq roared. “I betrayed my convictions before I betrayed you. I want my daughter, but not by owing to the darkness, not anymore.” Gost declared. Cyport charged and attacked Grutwaq. Grutwaq shot a beam at the robot, causing him to disassemble into pieces, but they started coming back together. Grutwaq shot a fireball which hit Cyport’s battery and crippled the robot’s ability to move. He then punched Skull Baron, who attempted to   strike from behind. Gost fought with Grutwaq, he attacked with his snake-amphibian arms, Grutwaq landed a purple blast, Gost hit the ground. “Now, it is time to finish the job!” Grutwaq said. He raised his tail and struck at Jake, but a force field blocked it. “What?” Grutwaq roared. This shield was not the one that Jake generated. The other three got up, they were glowing too. All four of them floated in the air and swirled around each other, then a light and struck them. “What, is going-” Grutwaq started. The light vanished and instead of four creatures, there was one giant creature in their place. It landed on the ground and roared. It was Osirisarses, the Great Dragon.</p>
