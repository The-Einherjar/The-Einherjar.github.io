    <h1>Reptile Man V: The Destiny of The Talismans</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
      It was time for preparation of the assault. Everyone who was called was present. They had just heard from Gost, that the cloud was sighted North. They were preparing the battle plan and getting weapons ready. Troy was getting the transportations, Alex was getting his army ready, everyone was busy. “This campaign is going to be big.” Pete said. “Pete, Frank, Tim you’re here?” Jake asked. “Yes, we decided to see how things are going with you. and Alex explained what all this preparation was about, so therefore, we are coming with you guys to attack this new foe.” Frank said. “Well, you’ll be most welcome.” Ryan said.
      <p>“We’re now ready, Ryan.” Troy said into a radio. “Good,  we must stay together as one unit.” Ryan said into another radio. “This is Garry,  my passengers and I are ready to depart at your command.” Troy said. “This is Mr. Gibbons, waiting for departure orders.” Mr. Gibbons said. “You’re coming too?” Jake asked. “Of course, we are, so get used to it.” Jill said. “Alright, follow me!” Ryan ordered. Every went north.</p>
      <p>“We are approximately three miles from Mount Vernon, and the location where Zarkqua is hiding.” Troy reported on the radio. “Troy, are you ready?” Jake asked. “I’m always ready.” Troy said. “Well, this wouldn’t be our first battle at Mount Vernon.” Alex said.</p>
      “Hang on!” Troy said. All the vehicles arrived. Zarakqua was above a hill. “Ready, Brandon?” Ryan asked. Brandon took to the air and fired energy beams.  Trevor used gravity to vault to the plague. He looked for the talismans. Hands with claws struck them, they plummeted. Brandon tried to hover, but his propulsion was wrecked. A metal object sailed the air, and rescued them. Gost and Skull Baron flew in with their aircraft. Cyport landed with Trevor and Brandon. “Better late than never.” Jake said. “Indeed.” Gost responded, he transformed into his amphibian appearance. He sprung into the air, Cyport and Skull Baron soared towards Zarakqua. The claws went in their direction. “Now, Jill!” Gost exclaimed. Jill changed into a white diamond dragon. She took flight and launched gold and white fire, the claws dissipated. Gost, Skull Baron, and Cyport faded in the cloud, they then landed with the talismans, they  threw them over to Jake, Trevor, Ryan, and Brandon.
