      <h1>Talisman IV</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
     Dritorexaris was a tall dragon-like figure with a curved sword. He had black armor and a red shield. He also had two wings with spine, tail was like a scorpion stinger, except it was more of a reptile tail with a razor-sharp spine on it. Jasoner charged at him, he was hit by the stinger. Dritorexaris slashed him with a glowing flame sword, Jasoner was on the ground unconscious. “It is just you and me now, “Legendary Heroes.” The dragon said, laughing an evil laugh. He added shot fire at Osirisareses, the dragon of the Talismans generated an elemental shield that blocked the fire stream. The evil general tried to slash at Osirisareses with his curved blade, but Talisar blocked the assault. Osirisareses charged the Vlfirpotence and struck with the sword. “Better than I thought, but then again, I thought you would try something better.” The general said. He hit Osirisareses with his tail, causing him to fall to the ground. The general then struck with his sword. In a flash of light, Osirisareses was gone, Talisar then struck, Osirisareses had appeared behind. They fought each other with their swords, whenever Osirisareses tried the Vlfirpotence against the general, it didn’t seem to work completely. “I studied the ancient writings for years. I know how to avoid your attacks from the Vlfir Force.” The general claimed. “Then I will use  other attacks.” Osirisareses said, at that moment, giant blasts of ice were shot from the dragon’s arms. It almost completely froze Dritorexaris. However, in a flash of red light, he broke out. Fire was surrounding him. He laughed, His tail burst into flames and he hit Osirisareses with it, this sent the dragon flying. He landed on boulders. The general laughed and shot a wave of flames. Osirisarseses tried to generate an elemental shield, but the attack broke through it, and now Osirisareses’s green diamond armor was beginning to melt. Rinazor flew at Dritorexaris, but the general hammered him with his sword. “I have been trained much better then you have. You may be powerful, but I know the secrets of defeating even the most powerful dragons and elementals.” The general boasted. “Pride comes before the fall!” Jasoner said, he flew and slammed into Dritorexaris. The wolf then shot lightning bolts, most of them were dodged, and the rest of them didn’t help very much. Jasoner was hit by a fiery tail and hit the ground. “My master will be pleased, the Vlfirpotence will be his, and you will be ended.” Dritorexaris said to Jasoner.  “Now that I think of it, perhaps I will take hold of the transcendent force, and seize the world for myself.” He uttered. Suddenly, the two giant talisman creatures glowed. The general was so confused, he couldn’t say anything. The two glowing energies containing Osirisareses and Jasoner swirled around and fused. When the light disappeared, a giant creature was in its place. It looked like a dragon, but with tough purple fur. It had two vast wings with two green diamond spikes on them, one on each wing. Its tail was at least fifty feet long. It had red, blue, and green diamond claws. It had icicle spikes going down to the  end of the tail, on the forehead, was a large rainbow diamond. The general was so shocked that he could hardly move, he then zoomed with his sword. The new fusion took up Talisar, the blade glowed with ice and lightning energy, the dragon slashed. The general instantly froze, the new fusion finished the general off with a blue and green blast. The frozen general shattered into icicle shards. “You beat him!” Verderk shouted. “Yes, you beat him, but you won’t beat me.” A voice said, it vaulted onto the ledge.  “It is time, Osirisareses, to finish what we began.” It pronounced. It was gray, it looked like a giant, except it had thorns on its  forearms and back. It also had a giant axe. “It’s the final general, Grutwaq.” Verderk said.
