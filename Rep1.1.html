      <h1>Reptile Man</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>There was a farm. “You made a hole in the pail, again!” His wife shrieked. “Sorry, but it was an accident!” The farmer hollered back. “What about this bill, that came from the mail? You going to pat it or not!” His wife hollered. Suddenly, a big boom was heard. “What the heck did your tractor do this time?” His grumpy wife said. The farmer went outside, he walked to a tree. There was an object shaped like a stone next to it. “Ah, a rock.” The farmer said to himself. Suddenly something came out.</p>

    <p>Jake was walking, suddenly, an old man walked by and gave him something. “Here, keep this. It is called the Reptile Talisman. Use it.” He said. “Huh?” Jake said. The old man vanished.</p>

      There is this family called the Gibbons. Today, was a grand swimming and pizza party at their house. Other than that, it was a normal day. Too normal to last, however. Jake was looking for somebody, suddenly, somebody tapped him on the shoulder and said, “Hi Jake!” Jake turned around, it was Jill Gibbons. It looked like she was the one who found him. A tall guy who was of about eighteen years, walked up. “I wanted you to meet somebone, this is Garry, he is my grandfather’s adopted son.” Jill said. “Hey, Jake.” Garry said. He and Jake shook hands. Suddenly, Jake felt a cold shiver, he started to move forward as if being drawn to something. He kept on walking until he stopped in front of someone. This someone was four feet tall, he was see through rubber. “Who are you?” Jake asked. “My name is Grutwaq, you dare challenge me?” He said, he threw a punch at Jake. Jake was sent flying, he hit the fence “Jake, are you alright?” Jill asked. Jake got up, Grutwaq started to walk over with evil eyes. Jake clenched the talisman. Suddenly, Jake changed shape. He now had a crocodile head, the arms of a monitor lizard, the tail of a anaconda, legs of a tortoise. “No way.” Jake thought. Rright before Grutwaq got close, Jake leaped and slashed him, it didn’t do very much, though. Jake swiped Grutwaq with his tail, Grutwaq caught it. Jake fell to the ground, Grutwaq took this advantage to elbow slam him. Jake got up and camouflaged. “What!” Grutwaq said. Jake appeared behind and slammed. “Nice try!”  Grutwaq shouted. Jake used his crocodile teeth on the menace, but no good “I shall return!” He vanished. Jake went over the fence and sneaked back as himself.
