      <h1>Reptile Man II: Hunt of the Talismans</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      There was a man named Gost. He lived a good life until there was a twister, afterwards, he couldn’t find his daughter. Grief changed him, now he vowed to find revenge on the storm, and to find her.  One day he changed his mind, he came across a High School football field. He had decided to be a teacher. Suddenly he found something on the ground. It was round and made from tone.  It was an ancient artifact it had an image of a frog on it. There was a book, he started to read: “I have discovered a way to take the world that rightfully belongs to me. Four Indian Transformation Talismans Fire, Water, Plant and Reptile. I must get them all. I have successfully acquired a talisman the amphibian talisman. The Reptile Talisman is coming to me.” He read. “This is my revenge all five talismans including the amphibian must have the power to destroy a storm. I will find my daughter” He said.
      <p>The secret passage opened. Gost turned around, someone was coming. He did not know what it was until it spoke. “I have come boss.” It said. “Oh yes greetings Manfred.” Gost said. The figure came up, it was inside a skeleton costume and had a sword on his belt. “Don’t call me Manfred. My name is The Skull Baron. Is the machine done yet?” The skeleton asked. “Almost.” Gost answered. “Good.” The skeleton said. “Our procedures are almost complete once this masterpiece is finished, we’ll start the search. Then we find the four talismans and then world conquest.” Gost said. “Good but there is one who might become a threat.” The Skull Baron said slowly. Gost turned toward Skull Baron.  “I heard of this Reptile in Lynnwood, I never took him seriously. As what you just said his power comes from a talisman?” Gost asked.  “The Reptile Talisman to be exact. He is quite powerful, but he does not know the talisman’s true power. Something that no known human can comprehend.” Skull Baron said. Gost went over to a large machine with a steel chamber inside. The chamber opened revealing a titanium object shaped like a human. “Say hello to the most advanced fighting robotic piece of art in the world.” Gost said. The Skull Baron stared. “What is it exactly?” He asked. “It is the Cyport,  an ancient automaton, I added to it. It is fast, and the outside is made entirely out of titanium, it can detect targets the instant they come on the scene, his arms can cut through any steel,” Gost said. "Let’s start.”
