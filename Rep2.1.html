      <h1>Reptile Man II: Hunt of the Talismans</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      It was a darker than usual, and stormy day. The worst of the rain however, was over and now there was light precipitation, some wind, and the occasional thunder in the distance. This however, was not just an ordinary tempest, for the air smelled of an impending showdown. On top of the highest skyscraper in this city of Seattle, there was a figure with a metal staff. This man had an attire of high-tech armor covered in rubber. He raised his staff, a bolt of lightning was attracted to it. With an evil laugh, the man swung the staff down, and when he did, the lightning shot from it and struck an empty car which exploded.
The three approached the tower from different angles, their goal, to stop the rubber man,. one was Jake, the Reptile Man, the second and third were Trevor, and Brandon. Trevor had red hair. His armament was a gravity field generator, he had a brother named Brandon, who had brown hair. He was armed with energy emitters, and no I do not know where they acquired them. “This guy again?” Trevor exclaimed, he vaulted towards the summit of the tower. ”I’ll delay him.” He said, they were talking with phones. ”Alright then, we’ll be right behind you in a jiffy.” Brandon replied. When Trevor was at the rubber man’s elevation, he stopped. His gravity prevented him from falling. The rubber man cackled. ”Ready to be shattered out of the skies?” He asked. ”Not a chance.” Trevor responded. The staff shot lightning at Trevor, the young man used gravity to direct the aim toward the sky. Jake soared behind the man and tackled him, the wrongdoer attacked with the staff, Brandon whizzed to the pole and warded it off, he afterwards shot energy at the rubber man. With this distraction, Jake punched the villain upwards and then leaped and drove the rubber desperado to the tower, the rubber man was caught.

      <p>There was a man named Gost. He lived a good life until there was a twister, afterwards, he couldn’t find his daughter. Grief changed him, now he vowed to find revenge on the storm, and to find her. One day, he came across a High School football field. He had decided to be a teacher. Suddenly, he found something on the ground. It was round and made from tone. It was an ancient artifact. it had an image of a frog on it. There was a book, he started to read: “I have discovered a way to take the world that rightfully belongs to me. Four Indian Transformation Talismans Fire, Water, Plant and Reptile. I must get them all. I have successfully acquired a talisman the amphibian talisman. The Reptile Talisman is coming to me.” He read. “This is my revenge all five talismans including the amphibian must have the power to destroy a storm. I will find my daughter” He said.</p>
      <p>The secret passage opened. Gost turned around, someone was coming. He did not know what it was until it spoke. “I have come boss.” It said. “Oh yes greetings Manfred.” Gost said. The figure came up, it was inside a skeleton costume and had a sword on his belt. “Is the machine done yet?” The skeleton asked. “Almost.” Gost answered. “Good.” The skeleton said. “Our procedures are almost complete once this masterpiece is finished, we’ll start the search. Then we find the four talismans and then world conquest.” Gost said. “Good but there is one who might become a threat.” The Skull Baron said slowly. Gost turned toward Skull Baron.  “I heard of this Reptile in Lynnwood, I never took him seriously. As what you just said his power comes from a talisman?” Gost asked.  “The Reptile Talisman to be exact. He is quite powerful, but he does not know the talisman’s true power. Something that no known human can comprehend.” Skull Baron said. Gost went over to a large machine with a steel chamber inside. The chamber opened revealing a titanium object shaped like a human. “Say hello to the most advanced fighting robotic piece of art in the world.” Gost said. The Skull Baron stared. “What is it exactly?” He asked. “It is the Cyport,  an ancient automaton, I added to it. It is fast, and the outside is made entirely out of titanium, it can detect targets the instant they come on the scene, his arms can cut through any steel,” Gost said. "Let’s start.”
