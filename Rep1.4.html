      <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
     
      It was the morning, and the sun was out. The temperature was not hot, but not cold either. There were trees, buildings, cars, people, and clouds that lit up gold from the of the sun. It seemed like a fine day. However, things were soon going to change. There were two people walking down the street, their names were Brian and Alex. "These new swords we bought will make nice decorations for the Thanksgiving Dinner." Brian said excitedly. "Yep, they are stainless steel, have gold handles, and they are light, not to mention the red, white, and blue for extra decoration." Alex said, looking at the two boxes. "What time is it?" Brian asked. "Why? There are plenty of days left until Thanksgiving. it is about seven-twenty." Alex said. "We’re late! Late for the celebration that our school finally won a Football game!  We’re going to be late!" Brian yelled out. "Let’s run!" Alex suggested. They both ran straight, without looking where they were headed. They crashed into something, it and they fell over. "Sorry sir- Ah Brian..." Alex said, scared. "What?" Brian asked. Alex pointed to the figure that got himself, or itself back on its feet. It was tall and it wore funny clothes. It had two big eyes, was purple, it was a humanlike toad! "I beg your pardon! I never been so disrespected!" It growled. "Ah...How did you... Are you in a costume" Brian asked. "I see you two have swords with you. I’ll make you two a deal, we will have a little two on one duel. If you two win, I will leave and never bother you again, but if you lose, I will make your lives miserable, and fill your lives with bad luck for as long as you two live!" The toad roared, drawing his own sword. It was long and looked heavy. The steel was shiny and dull at the same time; it had a gold handle with an image of a toad face carved on it. "Just fight me!" The toad ordered. "Okay." Brian said. They opened the two boxes and took out the two swords. "Now, put on your battle items." The toad said. "We don’t have any, besides Brian‘s ninja weapons, and my bow and arrows-" Alex said. "Really? That’s a shame." The toad laughed, he waved his sword. "This is the sword of changing." He then took a shield. "This is the shield of my battle skill, and my necklace is a symbol of my authority over my kind, and my armor is... well... just armor." He finished. "We are r-r-ready." Brian said shaking. "Bring it on." Said the toad. Alex charged with his sword, he tried to attack the toad with it, but the amphibian blocked the sword with his own. Brian came to attack, but he was blocked by the toad’s shield. Without much effort, the toad pushed both of them back. Brian reached into his pocket and took out a key chain. He threw it. It was blocked by the shield. Alex found a stick on the ground and picked it up, he charged with his two new weapons. The toad just sliced the stick in two pieces. "Let’s attack his back." Alex suggested. "Good idea." Brian said. Brian went to distract the toad while Alex went quietly behind. The toad leaped high in the air and took hold of a telephone pole before Alex could strike at him. Brian drew out an extra sword, except this was a ninja sword. Alex took out a bow from his backpack and a quiver full of arrows. Brian was trained in the art of the ninja, even though he was only fourteen, and Alex was an archer. "Nobody said we can’t use these in a duel!" Alex yelled out loud, so the toad could hear him. The toad leaped back to the ground. Brian charged with his two swords and attacked with both. The toad blocked with his sword and shield. "Alex! Shoot a arrow! He is defenseless! He is insane! Just aim at his arm." Brian said. Alex knocked an arrow, aimed carefully and shot the arrow. This would have been a victory, but the second the arrow hit, it bounced off. "What?" Brian said confused. "I have armor, remember?" The toad said, he pushed Brian away. Alex shot another arrow, the toad got out of the way and used his sword to slice the arrow in half. "How did you do that?" Alex asked. "I practiced a lot, by beating a lot of enemies. They are now suffering a life full of bad luck, the same thing that will happen to both of you." The toad said proudly. "Pride comes before the fall." Brian said. "Oh, really? So you think that, eh? Well, to get rid of your pride as a ninja, I shall use my sword of changing on you!" The toad laughed, his sword glowed and shot a beam at Brian. "I didn’t feel anything, take this." Brian said as he leaped at the amphibian. Before he reached him, he fell. Brian then charged, but something was wrong. He became slow and his sword strikes were like the strikes of a novice. "I have used my sword of changing, so you could change from a ninja expert, to a ninja novice." The toad laughed. Alex knocked an arrow, the toad shot a beam from his sword at him. Alex fired, but missed. "I now turned you into a pathetic archer that always misses, not that you weren’t pathetic from the start." The toad continued to laugh. The toad looked at his sword. "Time to finish you both off." He said. He quickly sliced Alex’s bow in half, he then knocked his sword out of his hand. The toad then knocked Alex to the ground and pointed the sword of changing at his throat. "You’re defeated." The toad declared. He then turned to Brian and knocked his two swords to the ground and knocked him to the ground. "I have won." The toad said. "Now, prepare for a life of bad luck!" The toad laughed. His sword glowed, and two beams of light hit Alex and Brian. "I still don’t feel any different." Alex said. "Not yet, but soon you’ll find that bad luck is with you. Now, if you two will excuse me, I have some work to do." The toad said, as he walked away and left Brian and Alex where they were...
