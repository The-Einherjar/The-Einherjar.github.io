    <h1>Reptile Man IV: The Flames of Rorzron</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
      The creatures wounded at the battle at Lynnwood were restored to health. It had been five weeks since the defeat of Zron. “Cyport is back one hundred percent proficiency.” Gost announced. “Terrific, I would like to see a Zorraider try to fight him.” Ryan said. “If a Zorraider comes, I’ll be ready.” Cyport responded. “It may not be a Zorraider, it may be worse.” Jill said. “What’s worse than a Zorraider?” Ryan asked. “The plague, Zarakqua.” Jill replied. “Yeah, that can be much worse.” Ryan said. “Gost, have you heard of anything called, Zarakqua, or Flameritilquaoak?” Brandon asked. Gost thought a moment. “Zarakqua, no. Flameritilquaoak, yes.” He said. “What is it?” Jake asked. “It is something that was on the Wall of Rorzron. It fell the in lava, during your battle with Growun.” Gost said. “So, it is destroyed.” Trevor uttered. “So, Flameritilquaoak is something that will happen after Zarakqua.” Ryan said. “But, what is it?” Trevor uttered. “We were mulling over the plague, but did not consider Flameritilquaoak.” Brandon said. “Guys, remember what we said when Ino told us about the plague? We will battle it together.” Jill stated. “Trials like the Firemancers will prepare you for what is coming.” Gost said. There were sirens all over the city. “Those too.” Gost declared. “Go get them, I’ll get more help.” Jill said. The four took their talismans, transformed and took off into the city.
