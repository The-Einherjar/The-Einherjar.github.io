  <h1>The Creature of Ancient Destruction</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
      “Who is this Growlor?” Jake asked. “He is the leader of a band of brigands. They have been plundering the town.”  Min Su said. “I heard about these bandits, I haven’t heard the leader’s name. I’ve been gone awhile.” Jake said. “My weapon used to belong to a warrior from an ancient land, Gzat.” Min Su said. Suddenly, a great wigned creature with a long spear landed. “This is Zrisitis, he has one of the weapons.” Min Su disclosed. “Any trouble around here?” Zrisitis asked. Cars came by, and stopped, Ryan, Trevor, Brandon, and Garry came out. Garry looked around and saw the broken rocks, he then looked at Zrisitis and Min Su. “Was there something I missed?” He asked.
      <p>“How dare you fail me!” The cloaked figure roared. “They were too much for us.” One of the minions said. “Go back, and destroy them now.” Growlor ordered. “How? They are more then we can handle.” The minion said confused. “Use your armor. This is our city, we will take what we want. I think it is time we save them for later and go after the one I have been hunting down.” Growlor said.</p>
  <p>The brigands were in the mall, searching for someone. They ran into a character that had a scimitar. “We meet again, Drr.” Growlor said. “ Growlor..” The character uttered. “You will either surrender your scimitar, or we will take it by force.” Growlor demanded. Drr ran to a fountain and drew the scimitar. “How about a third option?” He said. “So be it, force.” Growlor pronounced. He tossed his cloak and drew his dagger. “Once again, we are in battle.” He said. ”But now on different sides.” Drr said. Growlor leaped and attacked with his dagger, but the blow was blocked by Drr’s scimitar. “You cannot beat me, Growlor.” Drr said. “Then, I shall finish you with the power of my dagger.” Growlor said. His dagger glowed and he transformed into a creature that was like a purple Moltezron, the head was like a wolf. Drr’s scimitar glowed and he transformed into a great bear with silver fur, and scimitar-like claws. “This should be interesting.” One of Growlor’s minions said. Growlor tried to slash Drr with his claws but the used his claws to guard. Growlor’s tail smote the ground like a whip, he used the whip to toss Drr across the room. Drr got up, he charged at Growlor and slashed at his face. Growlor roared in pain, he and Drr changed back. “Growlor, you saved me during the battle of our home. Now, I will save your life by sparing it. I will also leave you with a warning to stop these  attacks.” Drr said, before he disappeared in the crowd. Growlor got up. “Big mistake.” He uttered. “You can’t defeat him, chief.” One of Growlor’s minions said. “I do not intend to destroy him, myself. I intend to show him the full terror of this band. It is time we demonstrate to this town, our supremacy.” Growlor said, he took out a stone from his pocket. It was flat, dark gray, and had an image of a dragon on it. “Chief! That, was for blackmail.” A minion stated. “It was, however, we have something beyond this talisman for that.” Growlor grinned an evil grin. The stone glowed and the ground shook and a roar filled the air..</p>
