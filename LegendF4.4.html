      <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    Jake couldn’t believe Jasoner was on earth. Three years ago, Jake and the other three Talisman wielders answered a request to save a different world. Jasoner somehow journeyed to Earth to ask them to save it. A sorcerer was trying to conquer. With help, they stopped the evil empire. They never heard from Jasoner since they arrived back home. “Yes, it is I.” He replied. “Are they from Trulaz?” Jake asked. “Yes, they are from Trulor.” Jasoner said. “After you left we had peace, but it didn’t last. A servant of the sorcerer has taken the role of emperor. His name is Zror. Now, he is seeking to take Trulaz, he gathered the sorcerer’s army. I have here because of a threat to your world, the emperor tried to attack a republic of towns protected by mountains. He failed. There were four people from Earth, they somehow trekked to Trulaz after you left. They were welcomed by the people in a town in the mountains, this was at the time of the liberation, by the news of the destruction of the sorcerer. The emperor thinks if he forces the girls of the four to marry two of his generals, he can gain loyalty from the mountain republic, or something. “The two girls, that were kidnapped today?” Jake asked. “Yes, and these two boys are the two others who were in the town.” Jasoner said. he indicated Chris, and Paulius.
      <p>“So, what now?” The principle asked. The principle, Jake, Jasoner, Paul, Chris, and Paulius were in the principle office. “I am going to intercept the group. They can’t travel as quickly because of their hostages.” Jasoner said. “I’ll go with you.” Paulius said. “I’ll also go.” Paul said. “I will.” Chris also. “I’m coming.” Jake said. “I will summon the creatures. I wish I could go with.” The principle said.</p>
      <p>They set out. They went east to the Cascade Mountains. Paul turned into a dragon, Jake turned into the reptile, Chris, and Paulius rode on Paul. Jasoner had four Talismans, which were from Trulaz. He transformed into a wolf that was yellow and blue with lightning around him. They camped for the night near a river. “Hey, Jasoner?” Jake asked. “Yes?” Jasoner said. “How is Verderk?” Jake asked. “He is a general of Luris Coldor.” Jasoner said. Verderk was a friend of Jasoner, Jake, and the three other Talisman wielders. Luris Coldor was the capital city of Luris. 
“General?” Jake asked.
“Yep.” Jasoner replied.
“General Verderk.” Jake tried. “I like it.”
“He was my replacement.” Jasoner commented.
“What?” Jake said.
“Not Verderk, Zror.” Jasoner answered. “As you know, the sorcerer killed my parents. He raised me to become his general, he trained me. Not to the point of sorcerer, but he trained me to use the sword. Most of the generals trained themselves. I never wanted to serve the evil despot, he knew, so he trained another. When I finally rose up against the tyrant, he summoned Zror. I thought my training was supreme to any other soldier in the empire, and so it was, except to the sorcerer and Zror. Zror was a hundred years old, I was fourteen. I fought him. Even my precision thinking and quickness was no match for him. Zror was not a man, or elf. The sorcerer was impressed with my skill, so he spared me and sent me the dungeon to teach me not to rise up against him. I escaped.” Jasoner said. 
“How old are you now?” Jake asked.
“21.” He answered.
</p>
<p>The next day, they continued to move. At sunset, they made it to the cave.</p>
