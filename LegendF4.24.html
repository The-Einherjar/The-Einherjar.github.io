      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 24</h2>
      He traveled deeper into the bowls of the Earth. He was seeking the fierce army of legends, the Fire, the ones who had driven the creatures who would become part of the Alliance of the Four Schools. He reached a dead end. There was a silver sword in a rocky pedestal; this was not what he wanted. He roared in frustration, he walked nearer to the sword, it was silver. He drew it. Just then, gray mist came out from where the sword was. “What is this?” The figure asked himself. “This is The Realm of Nightmares.” A voice said. “Who are you?” The figure asked. “My name is Grroror.” The voice answered. “What is this Realm of Nightmares?” The figure asked. “The place where Nightmares come to life. The place where power can be given to those who are feared.” Grroror said. “What kind of power?” The figure asked. “What do you want?” Grroror asked. “Can you give me creatures of nightmare?” The figure asked. “Yes, do you wish to conquer?” Grror asked. “Yes, two worlds.” The figure answered. “Two worlds conquered by you can spread our dominion. I’ll help you twist nightmarish soldiers.” Grroror said . “What is your name?” Grroror continued. “Zror.”
      <p>There were six of them around the boulder table. Three were generals of the Fire, one was a general of the Gitzons, and two were generals of Stouses. One of the Fire generals was a big flaming brute, another was a giant flaming winged lizard, and the third stood on six crab legs, had two arms with four claws on each hand, and it had a head. They were discussing attacking the surface. “We have thirty thousand Stouses ready.” A Stouse declared. “Who will lead?” The other Stouse asked. “Simple, I will.” The brute Fire general said. “You had your chance, General Flarog. I am the leader.” The crab lady said. “No, I am the leader! Our now dead Emperor favored my tactics.” The lizard said, the crab lady started toward him. “That is enough, Mistress Embras! General Treysor, your emperor favored your tactics, but I will be the leader.” The Gitzon roared. “You have the smallest numbers.” The first Stouse uttered. Suddenly, a figure entered. He was wearing gold armor, one set of his claws looked like they were half sliced off, he had red eyes, and a viper head. “Who are you?” Treysor demanded. “I am Zror.” The figure said. “What is your purpose here?” Treysor asked. “I heard your dispute. I am here to become your Dread Lord.” Zror pronounced. “What? You failed to defeat our enemies. Your three thousand soldiers were defeated.” Mistress Embras roared. “I have way more than three thousand.” Zror said. “We had an agreement to attack at the same time, you didn’t tell us when.” The Gitzon roared. Zror drew his new sword, it was silver. “You recognize this sword, don’t you?” Zror asked. He continued. “The sword of Growun, the Dread Lord, the dark lord of the Gitzons, and Dread Lizards, all of whom came from the Realm of Nightmare. Here is the deal, I still have hundreds of thousands of creatures in my realm, and I am also twisting an army in the Realm of Nightmares. If you join me, you will become High Lords of my empire, join me and the Empire of Rorzron will once again dominate Zat, then the two worlds.” Zror said.</p>
     They were in the palace of the Fire. There were many creatures, some like Flarog, there were orange creatures called Firelings, and there were shadowy creatures that looked like Firelings, they were called Shadowlings. The palace was gigantic, there were dozens of giant pillars. “I want you to attack the Alliance of the Four Schools.” Zror ordered. “With pleasure.” Flarog said.
