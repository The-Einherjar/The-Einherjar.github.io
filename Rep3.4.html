      <h1>Reptile Man III: Dawn of the Talismans</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
      Jake, and the warrior brothers were in an underground metropolis. There were torches on the ground, lightning the tunnel. The town was on the way to the road. A creature stepped toward them, it was an insect creature, like Ino. “Tim, is the gentleman awake?” He asked. “Yes, he is here.” Tim answered. The creature turned to Jake. “You are the keeper of the Reptile Talisman, are you not?” He asked. “Yes.” Jake responded. “I discerned the talisman the moment I heard there was a human was rescued from the volcanic abyss, I am Inou.” The creature said. “You know Ino?” Jake asked. “We have met. He is the warden of Bamtou, were the talismans were fashioned. I am the keeper of a sanctuary in this township. By the way, there is something I must show you.” Inou said.
      <p>Inou and Jake were in the sanctuary. They came upon walls of ancient writings, there were paintings of two dragons, one was on one wall, it was green, the second was on a second wall, it was dark gray. “Numerous centuries ago, there were four guardians. They were entrusted to protect humankind, after centuries of watch, they grew old, and couldn’t shield the world from evil. The light, and the darkness are in opposition to each other in every epoch. This needs to be. Without darkness, there can be no light. Humankind, and all creatures cannot partake of real joy if they do not know sorrow. However, evil endlessly attempts to destroy this, and to smother free will. Evil take many forms, and comes back. The guardians knew this, as they were passing on they trusted us Insters, their energy. With the guardian’s energy, we made the four talismans. We also crafted other talismans with energy of other honorable creatures, who passed on and entrusted their energy. The talismans were made to defend this earth. Regretfully, the other talismans were lost.” Inou told. “My friends and I recovered the other three of the four.” Jake said. “Thank goodness, there is an evil that has been released, Grutwaq.” Inou uttered. “Grutwaq, he is back?  How?” Jake burst out. “Jake, you and the other three must combine to form a creature known as Osirisareses, the great dragon.” Inou said. “How do we combine?” Jake asked. “I has not been done, before. You must find the answer. Sorry I am not much help.” Inou said. “No, you were huge help. Thank you!” Jake said. “You must make haste, take the brothers with you, they’ll help. I must prepare for war.” Inou replied.</p>
