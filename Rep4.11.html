    <h1>Reptile Man IV: The Flames of Rorzron</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
      Gost’s voice sounded like an echo. “We are the alliance of-” Gost started. “I know who you are. Allow me to introduce to you Zron’s real army.” A voice said. That moment, a great army came marching out of the gate. There was so many of them that the ground itself, shook. War cries echoed through the entire fortress. “I am Zron, the Powerful, the greatest of the three Firemancers. You are totally surrounded and outnumbered. Surrender and give me the gem, and you might be spared.” The Firemancer said. Gost looked behind, at his friends. He then transformed into his amphibian form and charged. A creature blew a horn. The four transformed into their talisman forms…
      <p>Xroyadrick approached the battle, he shot fire at Ryan. The two fire creatures fought.</p>
      <p>The Zorraider flew at Jill, and her father. “Time to conclude our duel.” He declared.</p>
      <p>Ryan slashed his axe at Xroyadrick’s wings, the Firemancer was grounded. He fired molten rock, Ryan teared through it and struck with his claws. Xroyadrick got up. “It’s over.” He pronounced. He revealed his gem, lightning discharged inside. Xroyadrick’s claws smashed it. A surge of red energy burst from the jewel.</p>
      <p>“Care to swordfight the six of us?” The Zorraider asked. There were six Zorradiers advancing at the two Gibbons, and Makaio. Gost came into the fray. “You’ll find your fire friend tied up the moment.” The stone figure said.</p>
      <p>Ryan crashed into a boulder. “That all you got?” He said. Xroyadrick, was at full power with his gem destroyed. Reb diamond tusks came out of his elbows, lightning danced within them. An ice blast hit the Firemancer. Trevor appeared, Brandon and Jake reached them over boulders. “We need bigger firepower…or ice power.” Ryan said. The four fused. Xroyadrick discharged lightning from the tusks. The blast struck the dragon. Osirisareses shot a gigantic ice blast, the Firemancer opened fire with…fire, this blazed through the ice. Osirisareses unleashed plasma bolt which broke Xroyadrick’s attack, the ice smashed into the Firemancer. Xroyadrick was frozen, the four shattered the Firemancer with their diamond armored tail.</p>
      <p>The Zorraiders fused into a colossal stone giant. “You should have given me the gem!” The colossus said. Garry shot a laser arrow, the bolt clanged off the stone. “Nice try.” The Zorraider cackled. Jill closed her eyes and focused. “Time to conclude!” The Zorraider declared. His axe and sword slashed. “It’s been a ball!” He said. Gold claws stopped the weapons, Jill had transformed.</p>
