    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <p>Later, Troy ran into two familiar faces. "Alex! Brian! Where were you two?" Troy asked. The two teens looked very tired. "We’d rather not talk about it." Alex said. Brian and Alex walked with Troy, they tripped a couple times. "Does anyone have a four-leaf clover?" Brian asked. "No, why?" Troy asked. "Ah, nothing." Brian answered. They kept on tripping. After some minutes, cold wet wind was blowing, but it didn’t hit Troy or anything. Instead, it hit Brian and Alex. Alex kicked an object into a sewer. "Hey! Do you have any idea what that was?" Brian asked. "No." Alex replied. "It was a real valuable and rare golden coin!" Brian said. "What! No, this can’t be happening to me!" Alex roared. "Are you sure you two are all right?" Troy asked. "Yes, we’re fine." Brian said. A few seconds later, Brian tripped again. ’There’s something wrong.’ Troy thought.</p>
    The toad went in front of the door. "Break this door down." The toad ordered. Two toads with hammers came and hit the door until it broke open. "Excellent." The toad said as he went in. There were people inside. "Alright, you will all be my servants and will work for me." The toad said. Suddenly, someone came upstairs to the floor. It was Jill. The toad saw her, and he dropped his sword. His eyes grew big and he snapped his fingers. His servants gave Jill a seat on the coach. "I think I found the one." The toad said. Jill’s phone, suddenly rang. "Give it to me." The toad said with a grin. Troy dialed the number. "Blast! It’s busy!" He said. The toad answered the phone. "Hello." He said. "Hi, this is Andrew. Is Jill home?" The person on the phone asked. "Andrew, eh? I believe we never met before. No, you don’t have the wrong number." The toad grinned. "Can I speak to Jill?" Andrew asked. "No, I want to speak to her first." The toad said, the grin gone. "I need to speak to her now! Alex and Brian are a-" Andrew was interrupted. "Patience is a virtue! But not for me! I am above patience! Now, if you won’t be patient, I’ll make you patient!" The toad roared, drawing out the sword of changing. The sword glowed. "What did you say?" Andrew asked. "You heard me! You now have a backache! Which will last you for ten years! That should teach you!“ The toad roared, his sword flashed. "Pests! You can’t avoid them! Now where was I?" The toad asked. The phone rang again. "What now!" The toad roared. "Is Jill home? This is Angela." Angela said. "Not another pest!" The toad said impatiently. "Pest? I beg your pardon." Angela said. "Prepare to change. Should I change you into a fish or a cow or a goat? No, I’ll turn you into a pig!" The toad roared. His sword flashed and he hung the phone up. The phone rang again. Rolling his eyes, the toad picked it up. "Hello." The toad said. "This is Troy, can I speak to-" Troy was cut off. "Let me guess, you want to speak to Jill." The toad interrupted. Troy paused for a few seconds. "Who are you?" Troy asked. "Ah, I’m sorry. My name is Magire Toad. I am the master now." The toad said. "I beg your pardon." Jill said. "Was that Jill? Can I speak to here already?" Troy asked. "Ah, come on Troy, let’s talk about something else like... Did you know I met two strange people who were carrying swords?" The toad said. "What were their names?" Troy asked  "I don’t have any clue, but I battled them in a duel and they lost, and I used my sword of changing to give them bad luck." The toad laughed. "I’d really like to talk to Jill." Troy said. "Why?" The toad asked. "Because of a newsflash that recently came up." Troy replied. "Well, you’ll have to wait. Call back later." The toad said, hanging up. "He is lucky I hung up before he grew impatient, or else he would have shared the same fate as my previous victims." The toad said, turning toward Jill. "Greetings Jill, I am Magire Toad. I am in charge now. However, you can be second in command if you accept my proposal." The toad said. "What is this proposal?" Jill asked. "You’ll see soon enough." The toad said, snapping his fingers.
