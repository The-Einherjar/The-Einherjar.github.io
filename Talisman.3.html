      They were in the realm of Trulaz, around them was some kind of wilderness. There were vast amounts of trees in the distance, beyond them were ice capped mountains. “We must make our way to the Canyon of Red Sunsets.” Zrenoroy said, pointing a direction.  “My name is not Zrenoroy, that is my travel name, only. My real name is Jasoner.” He stated. “What is at the canyon?” Trejakydon asked. Jasoner stared at the horizon. “They know you are here.” He said. He gazed further and turned toward Trejakydon. “We must move on. We shall find better passage to the through the road, it leads to ruins where we will rest, then continue later.” He spoke. They moved on for an hour, the sun was going down slowly. Within a few more hours it would be nightfall. They reached the ruins, they rested for a short moment on a small stone wall. “What are these ruins?” Trejakydon asked. “Used to be a great courtyard in the middle of a village, but many hundreds of years ago the dark king of Trulor sent his armies against the village and nothing of it remains but these ruins.” Jasoner answered. Loud roars from what seemed to be gigantic creatures were coming towards them. “They’re coming.” Jasoner drew his sword.  Trejakydon drew Talisar. “Who is coming?” Trejakydon inquired. The noises grew louder and louder, they moved toward higher ground. There, they saw another. “Zrenoroy, is that you?” He asked, standing up. “Yes, Verderk it’s me. The sorcerer’s giants are headed toward us.” Jasoner replied. “Indeed.” Verderk said, drawing out a long thin sword. Trejakydon turned into Osirisareses, He still had Talisar hand. Suddenly, five giants smashed some nearby trees. They were gray and wore silver armor. Verderk leaped on top of one of them and slashed the giant with his sword. Osirisareses took Talisar and sliced a giant on the foot. The colossus fell. The giant Verderk was atop  of grabbed him and threw him to the ground. Jasoner took down a giant with a sword that had three blades, like claws. Osirisareses was smashed down with a giant war hammer, he took to the air and charged with Talisar, and struck the giant.
