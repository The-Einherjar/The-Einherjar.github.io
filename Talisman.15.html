      <h1>Talisman IV</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 15</h2>
     There were giant icicles coming out of the ground, and they can see the fortress of the sorcerer. It was solid ice, with giant black boulders inside the ice. Willius called a halt, the great gates of ice opened and an armored creature on a giant bat came from the castle. Behind him, were two giants with great axes in their hands. When they near enough, the armored creature spoke. “I am the general of the sorcerer. You are trespassing in  your emperor’s realm. As such, he demands you pay taxes in all your arms. Afterward, you will go back to your people and yield the reigns of your government. The great king, Sorcerus, will then bequeath you of a garrison for…protection.” It said. Willius drew his sword. “It is unwise to not accept.” The general declared, it pointed at Willius. The two giants attacked. Osirisareses took Talisar and took them  down. The armored creature charged with his bat. Willius quickly got out of the way and sliced the creature into two icicles. The bat flew back to the fortress of ice. The gate opened more to reveal thousands of the sorcerer’s forces charging at them. Osirisareses and Jasoner, who turned into his Talisman fusion form, fought their way into the fortress. They then made their way up to the top of the tower. The soldiers drew their arms. “Stand firm!” King Cameris called. The sorcerer’s army stormed towards them. A radiant flame shot at the Sorcerus’s legions. There was a thunderous roar. A green diamond dragon landed next to Verderk. “Yes!” Verderk shouted. “Looks like we got a party to crash!” Rinazor said.
    <p>After fighting a large number of enemies they broke through a giant door. There he was, a phantom-like figure with a cape and a dark gold mask. One arm was missing, in its place was a dark gold artificial arm with a blade. “Jasoner, my old friend. Did you know that I killed his parents and tried to raise him as my general? Instead, he ran away and decided to try to stop me.” The sorcerer mocked . “That is enough, we got the Vlifr Force, you failed to get it. You are better off surrendering and taking responsibility for your crimes.” Jasoner declared. The sorcerer laughed and evil laugh. A black energy ball surrounded by lightning shot from his hand at Jasoner. Jasoner was was sent to the wall, he dropped to the floor. Osirisareses stood his ground, Talisar glowed orange with the Vlifr. “I longer need the Vlifer Force, it is old and weak. It represents the archaic world, a time of ancient powers. What this world needs is a new, enlightened sovereign, who will lead this realm into a new age. I have created a more potent power, the Dark Vlifrpotence.” The sorcerer said. “I have seen your age of “enlightenment”. You cast a shadow over free will and extinguish it. That is not what this world was meant to be. Yours isn’t an age of enlightenment, it is an age of darkness.” Jasoner stated.  The sorcerer shot a shadow blast from his hand, Osirisareses formed a shield out of the Vlifr. The blast hit it, Osirisareses pushed it back toward the sorcerer, who absorbed it in his blade. The dragon slashed an orange diamond shape into the air with his sword and shot it at the sorcerer, knocking him to a wall. He got up before Osirisareses could make a final blow. The great dragon quickly sent a wave of fire, the sorcerer formed a shadow cyclone, the fire was consumed. The sorcerer  changed shape, he now was a giant black, desolate tree with red eyes and sharp thorns on its branches, it was around one hundred feet tall. The sorcerer tried to hit the great dragon with its branches, but missed. Osirisareses  slashed the branch with Talisar, the sorcerer roared. The great dragon shot a gigantic ice blast, followed by his new diamond beam. The sorcerer broke out of the ice and took only medium damage from the diamond beam. Osirisareses shot a fire blast, but the sorcerer blocked it with a dark energy ball. Osirisareses was then hit by a branch, he fell to the ground. Before the sorcerer could finish him off, Jasoner came. He and Osirisareses fused into the lightning wolf dragon. The fusion instantly wrapped diamond thorns around the sorcerer. The great dragon now shot a beam of ice and lightning from his mouth. The sorcerer was frozen for about ten seconds before he broke out, but  was  weakened by the lightning. The gigantic tree monster launched shadow thistles. The great fusion dragon shielded Talisar, but was hit down to the ground  by a branch. The sorcerer laughed. “Did you really think your weak Talisman powers would defeat me? There is no hope, the world will bow before me. Too bad, you won’t get to see the rest of my victory.” He said. In secret, the great dragon charged up all the Vlfir energy. ‘Trejakydon, we have only one shot at this: Between his eyes.’ Jasoner said. Between the tree’s eyes, there was a crack. ‘We must not fail, everybody is depending on this. If we fail, this world, and possibly your world will be under the rule of this cruel dictator. We must succeed!’  “I’m aware I said that I did not need the Vlfir  Force, but more power never hurt anyone.” The sorcerer uttered. “Actually, there is always hope.” The fusion dragon said. “Wha-” The sorcerer started, but was interrupted because Talisar struck between his eyes in a quick ferocious attack. The great dragon was then off the ground, and in the air. Talisar glowed bright orange, and the sorcerer’s wooden monster form started to crack. Orange light erupted out of the cracks. “No!” The sorcerer roared. The great dragon broke through the nearest window and got out of the tower. Below the fortress, the sorcerer’s minions saw that their master was about to be destroyed, most of them fled. The light, suddenly burst out and destroyed the overlook tower, it  collapsed on the stronghold. “The sorcerer has been destroyed!” King Cameris shouted out. The Talisman fusion separated, and Osirisareses landed on the tower ruins and picked up Talisar. The quest was over.</p>
