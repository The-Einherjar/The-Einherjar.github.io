    <h1>Reptile Man IV: The Flames of Rorzron</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
     
The Zorraider attacked with the sword and axe, Jill was protected by her diamond armor. She shot gold and white fire. The Zorraider collided with a cliff, he threw the axe. The weapon converted into a snare and trapped Jill to the ground. The Zorraider swung the sword, however, a white beam crashed into the stone giant. “Cyport!” Gost exclaimed. The robot flew into view. Jill changed back, she escaped the trap, and altered back into a dragon. Her claws glowed white, clawed the Zorraider. The stone colossus cracked and collapsed.

      <p>“It looks like if I want something done, I will have to do it, myself! I do not need the gem to defeat them, I am Zron, the Powerful One!” Zron pronounced.</p>
      <p>Troy, Gost, Jill, Jake, Brandon, Trevor, Ryan, Danny, Richard, and David gathered together to search for Zron. They saw that the door to the tower was open. They located the two Stouses, they were quickly disarmed. “Where is Zron?” Gost asked. “He is expecting you.” One of them said. They kept going up the tower, battling a lot of enemies on the way. It took a while, but they reached the very top of the fortress, ahead of them was Zron. “Zron, I say we finish this.” Gost said. “Acceptable.” Zron responded, He slammed his tail on Gost causing him to fall off the tower. He was saved by Osirisareses and brought back up the tower. “Impressive, but survive this!” Zron said. He charged a lighting fireball and shot it at Osirisareses, who blocked it with an elemental shield. “Better than I thought.” Zron roared. He leaped at Troy but Gost got in the way. Jill went up to Zron and slashed him on the tail. Richard threw his spear at Zron, the Firemancer roared in pain and turned away from Gost and Troy, he pulled out the spear that hit him and threw it back, Osirisareses caught it and gave it back to Richard. Zron tackled Osirisareses and clawed him. Richard shot an arrow and Danny threw his axe. Zron tried to whip them with his tail, Jill changed into a dragon, preventing the tail from striking them, and taking Zron by surprise. He did not know a “little girl” was the dragon that defeated the giant Zorraider. David slashed his scimitar at Zron. Osirisareses shot a fire stream, Zron charged another fireball and threw it. The two attacks met and caused an explosion. Ryan gazed at the explosion, he thought of the time Xroyadrick destroyed his gem. Gost’s four arms stretched out and bit the Firemancer. Zron shot three fire streams that hit Gost and hurt him badly, but did not defeat him. Jill shot fire, Zron was sent towards the edge of the tower. and everyone else attacked with their weapons. Zron charged a fire attack and flew into the air. “Did you really think you can defeat me?” He laughed. “Gost, the gem!” Osirisareses articulated. “What?” Gost asked. “Give him the gem!” Osirisareses said. “I wouldn’t bring it here.” Gost replied. He changed back, and looked in his pocket. ‘Uh-oh.’ He thought. “Are you crazy? I know I am.” He did have it. “Hand over the gem to him, and we can end it.” Ryan said. Gost looked Ryan in the eyes. “Zron.” Gost called. He withdrew the gem. “Wise decision.” Zron said. Gost tossed it, the Firemancer caught it. “Gost, what are you doing? Troy cried. For a moment, Zron stared at them gem. His claws shattered it. Red energy erupted out of the smashed gemstone, Zron started to absorb the energy. “Now, Jill!” Ryan said. Jill flew toward Zron and clawed him, and flew upward. Zron flew up toward her. When the Firemancer was in the sky, Jill descended toward the tower. Osrisareses fired an ice blast mixed with plasma. It hit the red energy, a large explosion was triggered. Zron’s servants retreated underground. The explosion disappeared, Zron was gone. Osirisareses and the rest went back to the ground and Osirisareses changed back to his four original forms. “It is concluded.” Gost said. They returned to Lynnwood.</p>
