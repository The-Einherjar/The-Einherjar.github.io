    <h1>Reptile Man IV: The Flames of Rorzron</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
      “If Zron has a greater army in store for us, we are in big trouble.” Jake said. “Manfred, what you saw.” Gost said. “Seven million.” The Skull Baron said. “We only have four hundred able to fight, the rest are lost or wounded, and unable to fight.” Trevor said. “This must end.” Gost said. “We will to Rorzron and fight Zron, the four of us will end it.” Ryan stated. Brandon, Jake and Trevor nodded in concurringly.” No, Zron is not dimwitted. He will thrash you with everything at his disposal before you get to him, your energy will exhaust. Xroyadrick is there, as well. You might be able to take on Zron, though you might not, however, you cannot beat him, Xroyadrck, and their forces, not alone.” Gost said. “What if I went, too?” Jill asked. “If I could transform…then could we beat Zron?” She asked. “You may not return…” Gost replied. “Then, I will go.” Mr. Gibbons said. Gost sighed. “I will go with you.” He said. ”We’ll finish this, together.” Troy declared. He, Richard, Danny, and David stood. “If we destroy Zron, his forces might disperse.” Jake said. “Sounds like a good challenge to me.” Ryan said.
      <p>That moment, they departed with the rest of their forces, who were determined to end the war. They crossed the Puget Sound, and set off towards the Olympic Mountains. The rocky cliffs were foggy. “Jill, do you think you will transform?” Jake asked. “I don’t know, I tried at the battle, but I was unable to.” Jill answered. “Perhaps you need to trust your potential more.” Gost supposed. “What do you mean?” Jill asked. “We have potential we always realize, this can hold us back.” Gost said. “Ino said the transformation was difficult, that it requires a lot of energy.” Jill said. “Yes, but then again, difficult trials can make us stronger. It is conceivable that the energy required comes from something more than power. When did you transform? Gost asked. “When my friends were in danger.” Jill replied. “Immense danger.” Jake uttered. “I did not transform when Grutwaq was going to finish you.” Jill said. “He was not about to finish us, we had him.” Jake said, Jill gave him a stare. “Alright, he had us, but we fused into the spectrum dragon. Your transformation may not have activated then because the fusion stopped the peril for the moment. The other dangers had no fusion interrupting them, you came instead. Am I making sense?” Jake asked. “I think the energy came from your desire to save your friends, and it was answered by the transformation. Ino meant for you to reach your potential, and break the barrier.” Gost said. “Thank you.” Jill replied. Unknown to them, Zron already knew of their approach. With each step, the sky became darker and darker.</p>
