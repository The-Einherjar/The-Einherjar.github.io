  <h1>The Creature of Ancient Destruction</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 14</h2>
  Grutex was no more. Now the armies of Grutwaq were running away. “Follow them!” Cody ordered. “They will lead us to Grutwaq’s fortress. Good idea, Cody.” Jake said. “We must be swift, though.” Trevor stated. Cody’s flying chariots flew after Grutwaq’s minions, the rest followed. They followed the chariots until the sun was setting. They were now surrounded by rocky mountains, they were in Cascade Mountains There was a tower, constructed of purple diamond, encompassing  the tower were thousands upon of Grutwaq’s minions, they were reforming battle lines. Lightning flashed across the cloudy. “This is not going to be easy.” Ryan said. “What is the plan?” Jordan asked. “Ryan, Jake, Trevor, the Gibbons and I go inside the tower to destroy Grutwaq, while everyone distracts Grutwaq’s minions. When Grutwaq is destroyed, then all his minions will vanish to the Realm of Nightmares.” Brandon answered. “Ready, Cody?” Jake asked. “Anytime you like.” Cody replied. “I will come with you, you’ll need someone who knows Grutwaq’s architecture.” Gost requested. A war horn was blown. “This is it.” Min Su said. A flying chariot escorted by other chariots carried the four Talisman wielders, the Gibbons, Gost, and Repti to Grutwaq’s tower.
  <p>“Fire!” Cody ordered. Thousands of arrows were shot at one of Grutwaq’s flying reptiles. Catapults then fired stones at the enemy ranks. Lynnwood shield men, then moved in front of the Mountlake Terrace archer legionnaires to protect them from the arrows that were being fired by Grutwaq’s minions. Meadowdale commandos took care of the enemy catapults, and Edmonds Woodway artillery fired at flying reptiles to prevent them from attacking the archers. They were doing good so far, but didn’t know how long they could keep it up.</p>
  <p>They were in Grutwaq’s tower. They made their way up the stairs, fighting Grutwaq’guards. It seemed like the stairs had no end. Someone stepped on a trap door, Ryan, Jake, Trevor, and Brandon fell in, the door closed.</p>
  <p>They fell into a chamber with lava pits. “Where are we?” Brandon asked. “I don’t know.” Trevor answered. There was a loud roar, and a great hydra creature with ten heads burst out of the lava. The hydra had razor sharp claws and twenty red eyes glaring at the four intruders. “Does that answer your question?” Ryan asked. The hydra sliced at Ryan with it’s claws, it then shot fire at  Jake. Trevor shot ice, but the hydra shot fire to counter it. Jake  shot a plasma fireball, it didn’t harm the hydra very much. The hydra grabbed Brandon with it’s claws, all ten heads attempted to bite him, but Brandon quickly wrapped vines around the mouths. The hydra threw Brandon at the  wall.  Ryan slashed with his claw, the hydra shot fire from all ten heads. Trevor and Brandon fused into a ice warrior, Jake and Brandon fused into an orange dragon that was like Osirisareses, except without the ice, vines, fish tail, and the red horn. The dragon blocked the fire blast, the ice warrior shot ice, the hydra was frozen. “Let’s find the others before Grutwaq sends another welcoming committee!” Ryan suggested.</p>
