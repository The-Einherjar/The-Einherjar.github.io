      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 15</h2>
    All of them woke up and began their pursuit. Ryan turned into a dragon that had arms that were covered with fire, a great tail, two giant wings, and was armored with red and orange diamonds. He took flight. After a couple hours, they had lost the scent. “He must have mounted a dragon.” Jake stated. “There is a settlement ahead. Let’s ask if they know where Zror’s general flew.” Ryan said.
      <p>They entered the settlement. It was tiny; there was a stream near. The houses were built out of wood, the road was dirt, and the people were farmers. The four Talisman wielders transformed back before the entered so they wouldn’t scare the people. Nonetheless, the villagers were surprised because of the clothes the seven had. Apparently, people from Earth didn’t travel through here much. The people here wore the same clothes as people from the medieval period. The young men found an old man in his front yard. “Hi.” Ryan said. “Greetings.” The man answered. “Have you seen a dragon, lately?” Trevor asked. The man, who was working with a shovel, looked up from his work. “Aye.” He answered. “It was picking up Trulor soldiers. It gone east, they say an army is rampaging there. Reports say Zror is at the lead; he attacked a capital city, captured the people and razed the town to the ground.” He said.
“Have you seen anyone named, Jasoner” Jake asked.
“Heard he help defend the nation, and when it fell, he rescued prisoners, right under Zror’s nose too. The people were signing the lullaby about the legendary hero when he came.” The man said.
“There is a lullaby?” Brandon asked.
“Yes. The prisoners see the legendary hero as somebody standing up for freedom and good like the other heroes. We honor heroes. Just a patriotic poem against the forces of darkness, it is. The sorcerer was conquering the world, you know, enslaving people to his tyrannical empire.” The man said. Ryan gazed north. “I know what we must do now.” He said. “Right.” Trevor responded. “Is that way the Canyon of Red Sunsets?” Jake asked, pointing North West. “Yes.” The man answered.
