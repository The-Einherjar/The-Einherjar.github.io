      <h1>The Creature of Ancient Destruction</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
     The catapult fired a stone at Grutwaq’s minions. The battle had been going for half an hour. The three Talisman dragons landed on top of the wall, in response, the same flying reptiles that they fought in the Battle Of Maple Road came, except there were five of them, At least five others could be seen in the clouds waiting for their orders to attack. “Is that our cue?” Jake asked. “Yes, it is show time!” Ryan said. Four lights lit up and Ryan, Jake, Brandon, and Trevor were in their Talisman forms. Ryan picked up Brandon and tossed him on top of one of the flying reptiles. Jake and Trevor attacked the other one while the four Talisman dragons engaged the other three. By now, the minions of Grutwaq were using a battering ram to try to break the wall. Arrows were shot at them and many were hit by javelins, therefore, the wall was safe for now...
      <p>“General Grutex, we have spotted enemy forces coming toward our rear ranks attempting to surround us.” A minion of Grutwaq said. “Prepare the rear ranks for battle then.” Grutex ordered. “General Grutex, your tactics are starting to make me think that you are not capable of commanding this army.” The minion murmured. “It was not my fault we did not defeat the army of Kzat. It was their general’s insolent nephew that imprisoned Grutwaq, so don’t blame me.” Grutex said. “You failed to study the area.” The minion said. “You dare?! Send in the beast riders to harass the enemies that are coming, and go with them.” Grutex ordered.</p>
      <p>“Enemies are coming!” Cody shouted out. His soldiers formed ranks and prepared for battle. The pikemen lowered their spears, the archers were behind them with flying chariots above. The minions were riding on beasts. “Fire!” Cody called out. Arrows shot.</p>
      <p>The wall was still intact and the minions of Grutwaq’s morale was decreasing rapidly. Grutex was even thinking of retreating, but his pride and fear that he will be insulted by one of his own soldiers kept that from happening. He now came to the walls to oversee it’s destruction. Jill vaulted up and shot gold and white fire, she was not in her dragon form, however, she had her two dragon wings. The blaze struck a flying reptile, the beast plummeted. Grutex leaped at her, a great silver critter sprung into the air and intercepted. The two fell to the ground. Grutex drew his rapier and grabbed a spear, he tried to attack Drr. The bear evaded the spear and broke the rapier with his fangs. “You cannot defeat me that easily!” Grutex roared. The general jabbed the spear towards Drr, but Trevor froze it. Then, in one fell swoop, the colossal shadow of a plunging flying reptile came crashing down.</p>
