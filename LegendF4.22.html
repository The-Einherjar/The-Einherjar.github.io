      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 22</h2>
    Zror swung his blade and knocked Vederk’s blade to the ground. The ruler of Luris came running with a sword. Zror grinned. Jasoner was looking for Zror, while attacking minions. Then, he found Zror. He landed on the ground just as Zror was about to finish the ruler of Luris. “Zror!” He roared. “Jasoner, ready for our rematch?” Zror asked, he laughed without opening his mouth. His claws extended and struck Jasoner, then Zror absorbed Jasoner’s Talisman energy. Jasoner turned back from his transformed form, he drew his sword.
    <p>Ryan shot an orange energy blast at the last Elite of Zror. “They are not sending more.” Jake said. “Let’s attack.” Trevor suggested. Ryan blew a horn, the army of the Four Schools charged.</p>
    <p>Jasoner blocked. “Pathetic.” Zror said. “Do you really think you and those four can defeat me? You defeated the sorcerer, but I am more powerful than the sorcerer.” Zror boasted.</p>
    <p>The army of the four schools continued to charge. “Brainless.” Monstrost said. The armies met. The chariot carrying Chris and Paulius made its way toward the coach.</p>
    <p>“They are being attacked.” Jaclyn said with hope. They waited until the door opened, it was Chris and Paulius. “Hello.” Chris said. The girls were speechless. The two boys each handed them a white diamond sword. “Kept yours for you, we have ours.” Paulius explained. Just then, a horn blew. “I recognize that sound.” Cristine said.</p>
    <p>Thousands of cavalrymen clad in white and blue charged at the army of Zror. “The army of the Mountain Republic!” Monstrost shouted. Jake felt a sigh of relief.</p>
    <p>Cristine, Jaclyn, Paulius, and Chris entered the fray; they couldn’t stay where they were.</p>
    <p>Clang! Jasoner and Zror clashed their blades. Zror stuck again and disarmed Jasoner. “It ends here.” Zror laughed. “You may defeat me, but you won’t win at the end.” Jasoner replied. “Look around; my greatest conquest is near, the conquest of the capital city of Luris. Shame you won’t be here for the wedding. I’m sure Reqror and Monstrost, and even the two girls would have liked you to come.” Zror said, raising his sword. “He might, but not to this wedding.” A voice said, it was Jaclyn. Cristine, Paulius, and Chris were there too. Zror was speechless for a second, and then he grinned. “The four founders are here to stop me?” He asked. “We’ll try.” Jaclyn answered. Just then, the four diamond swords glowed. “What?” Paulius asked. “Those type of dragon spikes…they have a dormant energy…it starts up a hundred years after the dragon is born, the dragon that gave those to you must be that rare type, there are only fourteen in the world. Mountain Diamond Dragons.” Jasoner said, amazed. “Those dragons usually only live ninety-seven years. Almost none have lived for…” Zror said, his eyes flared. “Those dragons don’t just give their blades to anybody, who sent that dragon?” Zror demanded. “I did.” A voice answered. It was a young man, he had a lizard tail and silver arms. “Trillidron!? You were the sorcerer’s servant.” Zror roared. “He thought I was, I was really not. I fought the legendary heroes, so they would be ready to fight the sorcerer. I am the son of the old advisor to a mayor in the mountains. He came up with the idea of a republic. He was also a Gatelf, like me.” The young man said. “A what?” Chris asked. “A shift shaping elf.” Jasoner replied. “How do you think the legendary heroes knew about the attack on Luris Coldor by the sorcerer’s army? I told them, and that was not an accident. I saw these four young kids, and decided they were the ones to organize my father’s dream. The dragon gave them the four blades, in case they ran into trouble.” Trillidron said. “I no longer care about the losses of the sorcerer; they led me to taking over. It was a waste for you though, to build the republic.” Zror laughed. He leaped into the air, his cloak fell off. He wore gold armor, he had a snake tail. He landed on all four claws. Trillidron transformed into a reptile creature that stood on all fours, it was dark green with razor sharp teeth, it had two wings, and he had sharp spines on his shoulders. The two charged at each other. Zror fired red energy from his hands, they struck Trillidron, who was pushed back, and hit a building. “And now, the four founders.” Zror turned. He snatched back his sword, and grabbed Jasoner’s sword. He tried to strike Chris. Chris swung to meet it, but white lighting came out of the spike sword and hit the emperor. It sent Zror into the air, but he landed on all fours.</p>
    <p>The army of the republic and Zror’s had collided. Zror was losing. Monstrost made it to the four. “You know why they me Monstrost?” He asked. Two giant wings erupted, claws, also. He broke his helm to reveal a fierce monster, his eyes were red, and he had razor fangs. He leaped on top of a dragon. This dragon was a fierce brute, the largest in the army of Trulor. The dragon used its tail to hit Ryan, and shot fire at Brandon, who was now in trouble. Ryan hit the ground. “We need to fuse!” He shouted. All four of them fused. The great fusion dragon took off in the air and rammed into Monstrost’s dragon. Osirisareses then pushed back, and his thorn claws outstretched into vines.  Osirisareses used them to wrap around Monstrost’s dragon, he then crashed it on the ground. The dragon shot fire at the vines. Osirisareses shot ice from its icy arms, this froze the dragon. Monstrost flew at the fusion, claws outstretched. Osirisareses shot a bright blast that was yellow, green, and white from its mouth. “No!!” Monstrost roared.</p>
