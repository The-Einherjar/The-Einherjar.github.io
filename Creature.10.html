      <h1>The Creature of Ancient Destruction</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  
    
    Garry opened a door, some water came in. He walked inside the ancient Marineer fortress. Sand covered the ground. Before Garry moved further, a voice echoed and broke the silence. “I have been waiting for you, Garry Gibbons.” Garry looked around. “Who are you?” He asked, drawing his sword. You can’t escape...” The voice said. The door collapsed and trapped Garry inside the fortress. “What are you doing?” Garry shouted. “Allow me to review your life.” The voice said. The sand glowed and showed an image of a baby, it was Garry. “Your parents gave you a name, and that name was Garry. Your parents were forced to work for a criminal, they  decided to fight back and died as a result. You were brought to an orphanage and stayed there for a long time, until at last, you were adopted by a man with name, Gibbons. You were trapped in a prison and released. You fought in the Nightmare World. You searched for the Four Talismans.” The voice said. Garry looked around, but all he could see was sand showing him his past. “You  think you can carry the Golden Blade? Your journey is one of unfathomable peril.” The voice uttered. “I don’t know if I can carry it. I do know that I will not allow Grutwaq to extinquish those I care for.” Garry said. Suddenly, the reflection on the sand vanished, a creature landed on the sand. It was five feet tall, it had six armored legs and four arms with claws. It had a crab head and armor. It stared at Garry and attacked without warning. Garry slashed at it with his sword, and ran to a higher place and shot an arrow at it. This stunned the crab for but it attacked again. It chased Garry around the room, it was so fast that Garry didn’t have time to load his arrows. He finally threw the sword at the crab. The sword pierced through the armor, the crab disappeared. It was an illusion. The ground shook and the broken door was gone, the exit was reestablished. Garry saw a  gold sword handle in the sand. ”Remember.” The voice expressed.
