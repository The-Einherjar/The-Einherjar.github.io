    <h1>Reptile Man III: Dawn of the Talismans</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
    Osirisareses, the Great Dragon glared at Grutwaq. “Almost done.” Grower said, cutting the rope. Grutwaq was speechless. The dragon took to the air. “You shall not escape!” Grutwaq roared, he shot a fireball. It missed broke down the ceiling and a large section of the wall. In fact, they could see the two armies and the two armies could see them. “So, they fused together, finally.” Ino said. “I’m getting tired of you.” Grutwaq said. Osirisareses shot a fireball. “Oh no! The fireball again.” Grutwaq mocked. When the ball of fire hit, Grutwaq roared in pain. Osirisareses was a thirty two foot high dragon with two wings that were larger then Ryan’s. This dragon had green diamond armor, the head was shaped like Jake’s talisman head, and had a red horn. The end of the tail looked like a fish tail. The arms had ice covering the armor for extra protection, each of the claws were actually thorns. Grutwaq shot his own fireball, Osirisareses generated a shield from all four elements he was made from: Reptile, Fire, Aqua and Plant. The fireball reflected right back at Grutwaq, who was forced to the wall, or what was left of it anyway. Grutwaq flew over to the opposite end of the room, he charged a beam. “Not so fast!” Osirisareses said. He, or they shot their thorn claws as vines, they wrapped around Grutwaq. They then let go and tossed Grutwaq on the ground. Then they shot a stream of fire. “That must have hurt.” Jill said. Grutwaq got up, he was indeed hurt. Steam was coming out of him because his rubber armor was starting to melt. “And we are just getting warmed up, or should we say, cooled down?” Osirisareses said. Holes opened in their icy arms, and a huge ice blast never before seen from Trevor, shot out and froze Grutwaq. They then bombarded Grutwaq with a plasma wave, this broke the ice, Grutwaq plunged to the ground, steaming rapidly from the wave. Grutwaq got up, he lifted up his sting tail and tried to strike, but Osirisareses just grabbed it and twirled toward the wall. Before they could let go, Grutwaq got himself out of the grasp, he then started to shoot energy bolts. “Ouch. Take this!” Osirisareses said as they shot multiple waves of solar blasts. The two types of blasts hit and blocked each other. “Done!” Grower said. The rope broke off and the Gibbons were free to attack Grutwaq. Mr. Gibbons took out the sword of Zat from its sheath. Jill, Caleb, Brianna, Shealee, and Mal took the bows they had earlier. Garry took out his sword and bow. 
    <p>Down in the battle, Ino, Brian, Frank, Tim, Troy, Makaio, Michael, Pete and the army of Alex were fighting desperately, trying to break the ranks of minions. Suddenly, the general of Grutwaq approached Alex. He swung his sword. Alex blocked with his, but the general’s sword was so large and heavy that Alex’s sword broke into pieces. Only a small part of the blade remained. “Now you shall lose.” The general said. He was shot by three arrows, Tim, Frank and Pete came to the rescue. The general charged with his creature. Alex picked up a shard from his sword and threw it. The general turned back. Alex looked at his broken sword. The general lifted up his sword. “I have won this battle.” He declared. Alex threw the sword into the enemy general’s heart; the general fell off his creature and landed on the ground.</p>
      <p>When Grutwaq saw that his general died, he roared. The minions saw what happened to their best warrior, panicked and retreated back to the fortress. “This battle is not over yet! I will still win! You think all my great servants are gone? Think again!” Grutwaq roared. There was then screeching in the air. Two giant dragons flew into the scene. When Grutwaq’s minions saw this, they turned from the fortress and charged at the Kzat army again. “I thought they were destroyed!” Mallory said. “You are in my trap now!” Grutwaq laughed. “All your friends out there will soon be no longer with us.” He continued. Jill shot an arrow at Grutwaq, he turned and walked toward her. Garry took his sword and slashed at Grutwaq’s tail. Caleb shot another arrow. The rest of them threw defense daggers that Frank, Tim and Pete gave them in case the house was breached. Grutwaq cried out in great pain for the very fact the weapons were being used by his worst enemies. Osirisarses took this chance to strike Grutwaq with their razor sharp spikes. Grutwaq tumbled to the ground but got up quickly. “It is the end!” He roared charging a huge energy bolt bigger than any of the others he used, he directed all his energy. He laughed, Jake, Ryan, Trevor, and Brandon gathered all the strength they had into a beam in . “The end is now!!” Grutwaq howled. Osirisareses released the beam, it was yellow green and white, and it glowed radiance. It hit Grutwaq with full force. “No!!” He roared. Steam was all around him, they could not tell if he was still there. The four talisman guardians were forced back into their original human forms, since they used up all their energy. The steam cleared. Grutwaq had been reduced to like he was when Jake first fought him. The remains armor was melted. “How dare you!” He shrieked. “We have succeeded in our part in this fight. Now Mr. Gibbons, finish him off” Jake said. .Grutwaq tried to charge up a beam, Mr. Gibbons took his sword. The two dragons were causing tons of trouble now, they were about to finish off the army with a blaze of fire. Mr. Gibbons quickly stabbed Grutwaq. “I have failed. I am finished. I have been unable to complete my revenge. I will someday-” Grutwaq fell to the ground. The sword of Zat glowed, Grutwaq disappeared. The dragons were one inch from victory. Suddenly, they roared as if they were in pain. They were moving like crazy and suddenly, they disappeared. The minions of Grutwaq were terrified, and tried to run. The sword of Zat kept glowing. The minions then also disappeared. The fortress then made a loud boom and rocks flew all over. Alex’s army ran a distance from it. Some lava came out. The fortress shook wildly. Grutwaq’s towers collapsed and were buried underneath the rocks. The fortress and all the rooms were crushed, and in an earthquake, the rocks crumbled together and made a round shape. The great doors were crushed, never to be heard from again. The mountain was now what it used to be, Mt. Baker.</p>
