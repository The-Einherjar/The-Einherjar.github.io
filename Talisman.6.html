      <h1>Talisman IV</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
      The heat was getting intense, there was no water. It was completely silent as if nothing had set foot in the place for a long time. They all stopped for a short rest, they were running low on water. Then something happened. “Hahahaha!” A voice laughed.  “Who is it?” Verderk asked. The thing was short and was covered in ice armor. In its hands was an ice axe. Giants appeared behind him. “Icy.” Jasoner said. “That is General Icy to you!” The thing roared. It leaped and attacked. Jasoner took out his sword and defended himself. Trejakydon turned into Osirisareses and Verderk took his sword, both of the were by attacked the giants while Jasoner was fighting Icy. “I’m going to break your little sword, hahhaha!” Icy laughed. “I don’t have just a sword!” Jasoner said. Icy took his axe and threw it. Jasoner blocked with his sword but the force of the throw propelled the blade to the ground. Icy was about to finish Jasoner off when Jasoner took a small stone out of his pocket and glowed. He turned into a large yellow and blue wolf with electricity around him, he then dodged the attack with great speed. “What?” Icy bellowed, confused. Jasoner changed back into himself. “I used a Talisman. One of four Lightning Wolf Talismans in matter of fact, and I have them all. The one I used, the Zeta, was for speed and-” Jasoner started to say, but was interrupted by another attempted attack. Jasoner took out another Talisman and changed into a wolf that stood on two legs and he had two large armored  arms. He blocked the attack. “This is defense, Selsa, and this is Beta!” He said, changing again. This time,  he had six enormous claws that looked like swords. He sliced at Icy with all of them, but this was just to back him off. He then changed again into Alpha, a wolf that still walked on two legs, two spikes with lightning charging on his back. Lightning appeared on his hands and they shot a blast of blue energy. Icy’s armor melted, he vanished. At the same time, the giants were defeated. “Finally, we got water!” Jasoner said.</main>
