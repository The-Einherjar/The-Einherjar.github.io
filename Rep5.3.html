    <h1>Reptile Man V: The Destiny of The Talismans</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    “The time is come; I checked the plague’s seal, it has escaped.” Ino said. “Then, we should get out there and fight it, right?” Ryan asked. “Not yet, you need rest, much of your strength has been expended.” Ino answered. “How powerful is this plague?” Brandon asked. “Formidable enough to nearly overthrow the entire Inster order.” Ino said. ”We should call the others.” Jake uttered. “This beyond my knowledge,  time is running out. I am young for an Inster, nonetheless, I don’t have any children to take my place as guardian of the monument of Bamtou. If I end, the line of Inolamp, my grandfather, will be nearly ended. Then you four, will be the ones left to guard Bamtou.” Ino said.
    <p>The four talisman wielders were in Alderwood Mall, they were waiting for their allies. It was a busy day there, not like the day of the Battle of Alderwood, when the mall was empty. Suddenly, the lights turned off. “I don’t understand, the power was working without any trouble of any kind when last I checked.” A worker said into a phone. The mall had a team that went down into the basement to check the power. “What do you mean there is nothing wrong? Then, what do you call this?” The worker continued. “Something's coming.” Ryan said. “The light outside seems to be dim.” Jake said. They went to the nearest exit, they saw dark gray cloud surrounded by black lightning, it bombarded the mall with the discharges. “What’s that?” Trevor asked. “The plague.” Ryan said. The four of them turned into their talisman forms, they then flew and landed on the roof of the mall.  The cloud formed into the shape of a serpent, it attacked the four. Trevor and Brandon shot an ice and solar blast. Zarakqua was hit, but it did not defeat it. “Since this is the plague, let’s attack it with our best firepower.” Brandon said. Osirisareses leaped and attacked Zarakqua. The serpent changed into a giant  worm with fangs, it shot venomous darts. Osirisareses blocked with an elemental shield. He then attacked with a fireball, the colossal worm fell over, however it changed quickly into a giant falcon. It took wing and battled with the dragon. Osirisareses shot his great ice blast, this froze the falcon, it then changed into a shape of a Moltezron. Osirisareses then shot the radiance beam that was used against Grutwaq, when the beam struck, the black shape exploded. Osirisareses, however turned back into his four original human forms, since he used such a powerful attack. The dark shape came back together. Four clawed hands extended and took the talismans. The plague retreated.</p>
