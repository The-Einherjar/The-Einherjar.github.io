    <h1>Reptile Man III: Dawn of the Talismans</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
      The great doors of Grutwaq’s lair opened. A great servant of Grutwaq came in with the Gibbons. “Quite good, my minion you shall be rewarded later. For now, you are the general of my great army of fifty thousand. Now be gone.” Grutwaq said. The minion tied them to a pole and left the room. “At last, I shall get my revenge. You don’t know how long I have been waiting for this, over thousand years. Perhaps I should tell you the story so you will understand.” Grutwaq said. “Oh, we understand.” Brianna said. “You destroyed the lives of thousands of innocent people.” Jill finished. “I hail from a distant sphere. There, I lived war. A tyrant fought a campaign of destruction on my world. I found that the only way to endure, was to become a tyrant. Without tyranny there is disorder, and conflict. Life cannot be trusted to be free.” Grutwaq said. “The old despotic excuse.” Mr. Gibbons uttered. “People are not perfect, but totalitarianism doesn’t protect, it destroys. People need to be able to choose good, not controlled to choose.” He articulated. “Ino voiced what you said. I used to think it.” Inoik said. “Inoik, surely you have seen people’s capability to choose good. I have seen it, I have seen great good in individuals. I have seen kindness and compassion. I have seen I have seen courage, and honesty. I believe you have forgotten.” Mr. Gibbons said. Grutwaq clapped. “Oh, Gibbons, such a noble knight, your ancestor was, too. It’s almost a shame I must lock you all away. However, you are the ones who can defeat me. I can’t have that, not before I take what is rightfully mine.” He declared. “Do you believe what you said about order? Or do you just crave power?” Mal asked. Grutwaq again clapped. “I cannot deceive you, can I?” He laughed. “I came from Pluto and came over here to earth. When I saw Kzat, I knew it rightfully belonged to me. I went to the King. I asked him for the kingdom. He said no ,of course. I destroyed an entire farm, he sent soldiers after me. I decided to go by force. I destroyed villages, and farms, I then started to get on the big part. I went on to attack cities and fortresses with my armies, when the Kzatian forces assembled against me there was the great battle at Kzatrir, the capital. The general had the sword of Zat, a great blade that is said to be the greatest weapon forged in the history of Kzat. I went to fight him myself, while my army kept his army busy. I managed to slay  him. Then,  the nephew of the general Gibbons took up the sword of Zat, and fought me, he took the Tablet of Zat, and the dagger. He kept me busy with the sword, and spoke the words and then threw the dagger. It trapped me in a prison. I wanted revenge on him, but since he is died long ago, it is proper to imprison his descendants instead.” Grutwaq said taking out a jar. “My army will get rid of most of your friends, and as for your three allies, that tree that walks, the fish out of water, and that ridiculous furnace creature of yours, they don’t stand a chance.” Grutwaq said. An alarm went off. “Master, we are under attack!” A minion said running in. “Already?” Grutwaq exclaimed. They went to the window carved on the side of the mountain to see an army of men wielding the flag of Kzat. “Piece of cake. Send the army and finish them off.” Grutwaq ordered.
