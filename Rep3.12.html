    <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
      They were at the Gibbons. Ino was looking at the stars. “He wasn’t fully evil at heart was he?” Jake asked. “No, he wasn’t.” Ino said. Gost walked by. “Well, now I go looking for my daughter, again.” He said. “You’ll find her.” Jake replied. “Yes, I will never quit.” Gost declared. “What are you going to do?” Trevor asked. “I thought about being a teacher.” Gost said. “Teacher?” Ryan asked. “High school teacher, see you in class.” Gost answered. He walked to the house. Jill came. “So, we’re getting a new teacher.” She said. “Yep.” Ryan responded nervously. “He’ll be fine.” Jake said. “You’ll need an ally like Gost.” Ino stated. “Why do you say that?” Brandon inquired. “Your task is far from done.” A voice said. Inezet approached. “There will be a great darkness that will threaten the world, and you will need to defeat it. The prophesy was written in this poem:

One Talisman for Fire
Which Heats the Good Side Higher
One Talisman for Aqua
To Defeat the Plague Called Zarakqua
One Talisman for Plants
To Protect the Earth from Evil Hands
One Talisman for Reptiles 
Forged in The Great Tiles
Four Talismans to Banish the foul
Four Talismans to Seal The darkness in Prison Walls
Four Talismans to Save The Earth
And on Flameritilquaoak’s Eve, Stop the Plague’s rebirth.”Inezet articulated. “What is this plague? Trevor asked. “I am not aware.” Inezet confessed. “It is a darkness that is fear.” Ino answered. “Fear?” Jill said. “Yes, we Insters warred with it, centuries ago. I was not there, my father only mentioned it little. The confrontation took a toll on him. I do know that it will stretch its claws again, and we need to prepare for it.” Ino said. “We will help.” Jill said. “We will battle it together.” Jake replied. “For, I am Lord of the Oaks.” Brandon said. “And I’m The Fish Master.” Trevor said. “And I’m Fire Reptile Man.” Ryan said. “And I’m Reptile Man.” Jake finished.
