    <h1>Reptile Man V: The Destiny of The Talismans</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
      With teleportation, they were there. “Where are we?” Brandon asked. “This is Bamtou, the place where the Talismans were crafted.” An Inster said. “This is my nephew, Inokrezidir.” Ino said. “Where are the others?” Trevor asked. “You four are the only ones here.” Ino explained. “Why are we here?” Jake asked. “It is time.” Ino said. “Time?” Ryan asked. “We must send the talismans to their journey to the hall of fame of my fathers. There, Zarakqua will be undone. However, it will take time.“ Ino said.  “How much time?” Ryan asked handing his to Ino. “I don’t know, it may be centuries. ” Ino responded. Trevor gave Ino his talisman, Brandon did the same. Inokrezidir put them in three holes in the wall. “This is it.” Jake said, he handed Ino his. The Reptile Talisman was deposited. “After a one and a half thousand years, the four talismans are once again together in Bamtou.” Ino said. The talismans were withdrawn further in the niches, the holes closed. “You have done well, continue to fight for the light. Farewell...” Ino said.
      <p>They were all back at the Gibbons house at a party. “So, it’s over with the Talisman?” Jill asked. “It may.” Jake said. “We can still do good.” Troy said. “Yes.” Ryan said. Gost came. “Did the plague/reptile fight the plague because Brianna fed him?” Troy asked. “I think he fought on our side not only because of the meal. The plague creatures disappeared after Zarakqua was trapped. Our reptile didn’t, he is not bound to the plague. The plague creatures were extensions of the plague, Repti, is not.” Gost said. “Repti?” Trevor asked. “We call him “Repti”.” Jill replied. “Ah.” Brandon said. “I think he feels friendship with the Gibbons.” Gost said. “You think the radiant beam did something?” Jake inquired. “I do not know if he is part of the plague. He is a creature of the Nightmare World. However, I was analyzing Repti, and I don’t think the Nightmare World was always the “Nightmare World”.” Gost revealed. “It was transformed by Zarakqua?” Ryan asked. “Perhaps. The plague came to our earth from the realm of nightmares.” Gost  answered.  A police siren went off. “Let’s go. I got my pre-talisman weapon.” Brandon said. “Us too.” Ryan and Trevor responded. Repti appeared from camouflage, he growled, thrilled to go on an operation. A green light glowed. “Jake, you just turned into Reptile Man, again!” Jill exclaimed. “How?” Jake asked, ecstatic.  “You’re Reptile Man.” Gost responded. “Let’s go then.” Jake said. “Shall we?” Troy asked. “Absolutely.” Jill replied, wings appeared on her back. They took off into the sunset.</p>
