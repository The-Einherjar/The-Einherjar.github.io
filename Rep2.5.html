        <h1>Reptile Man II: Hunt of the Talisman</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
      The gate closed. There was complete silence for a few seconds. Inoik shouted. “Finally, I am free of that Nightmare World! Now, I could do what I tried to start!” The robot stood there. “Wait just a minute! I demand you to explain yourself! I wanted a war in the Nightmare World, but no! Whoever you are, you jumped from the Nightmare World and closed it!” He shouted at Inoik. “Huh? Your point?” Inoik shot back. 
”The point, you interfered with our battle, and I was winning!” The robot roared in frustration. “So, you think that you can overpower me?” Inoik asked. ‘Not a bad idea.” The machine said, he charged a beam. Inoik stood still. When the beam was unleashed, Inoik leaped out of the way. “Not bad for an insect!” The robot sneered. Inoik took his claw and charged black energy around it, and sliced at the robot with it.  This caused an explosion that blew the robot in four pieces, but they were brought back together. At that moment, Gost woke up. He clenched his talisman and turned back into his amphibian form. Inoik turned away from the robot and shouted. “Ino! You are here to stop me again?” Inoik clawed Ino, and took off with his insect wings. He shot a red beam that was like Ino’s, at Garry. The blast was blocked by Garry’s energy shield. Garry then shot a laser arrow back, Jake shot a fireball to go with it. When the smoke cleared Inoik was gone but appeared behind Garry, and shot another red beam. Ino used his own wings to intercept Inoik, but was clawed again, causing him to crash to the ground. Inoik then stood still. His eyes turned black, two razor sharp stones of granite with dark gas swirling around them came up from behind Inoik and shot toward the ground. Nobody was hit, but the impact made the two stones break into lots of sharp pieces and they hit Jake, Garry, Brandon,  and Trevor. Brandon held up his fist and charged lightning around it, then jumped up and punched Inoik. This caused Inoik to shake a little, but not enough.  Inoik stayed where he was, laughing. “All of you disappoint me, I thought that if my brother Ino ever assembled a defense team force against me, it would be great warriors not a bunch of weak, mouse class humans.” Inoik mocked. Jake used his flying lizard wings to get up to Inoik, he then swung his large tail at him. Inoik was sent a few feet back. Jake then shot a stream of energy. Inoik struck back with another red beam, this time more powerful, this sent Jake back crashing to the ground. “Bring him down Trevor.” Troy said. “It would be a pleasure.” Trevor responded, he used his gravity to bring Inoik to the ground. Inoik tried to take off again, but Trevor did not allow it. Makaio ran over and attacked with his blade. Ryan came over and hit Inoik with both staffs and shot shockwaves out of them.. Michael came over and struck Inoik with his axe and spear. Inoik’s arthropod armor was durable. Inoik formed an energy blade circle around him that hit everybody within ten feet of him. Gost went up to him. “Excuse me, but we are wasting time. I am Gost, I am on the same side as you. I suggest that we get the other three Talismans first, and then we can finish them off. Best part last you know.” He said. “Well, yes you are right, I have had enough fun for one day, come.” Inoik said. He turned back and said one last thing. “Don’t think you are superior because I spared you, for I shall return to finish you off for once and for all!” With that, Skull Baron’s aircraft came and picked the four of them up, and took off. It was so fast that no one bothered to go after it. “Well, they got away again!” Garry said. “Now they will ignore us, until they find the other three talismans. If they find those, we are finished.” Ino said. “So, we can’t stop them?” Ryan asked. “Come on, there must be some way.” Troy said. Jill came. “Why don’t we find all the Talismans before they do?” She suggested. “Find them first…” Jake said. “Ino, weren’t you the one who hid the other three?” Jill asked. “Yes.” Ino replied. “Do you remember where you put them?” Jake asked. “I think I remember.” Ino answered. “Will you lead us to them?” Garry asked. “I will.” Ino said. 
“Then it is settled we will meet at the Gibbon’s house tonight. Be there or be square.” Makaio said. Then, they all went home to rest. They did not know what other danger was ahead. The fate of the world depended on them. Little did they know it, but in the background of the sky was the sound of Inoik’s evil laugh.
