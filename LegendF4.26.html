      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 26</h2>
     The great stone door was demolished, towering creatures of fire stood at the gateway. “Captain Ryan, at last we meet.” A fire soldier uttered. ”Who am I addressing?” Ryan inquired. The fire colossus laughed. ”I am General Flarog! It was I who headed the  fire warriors in the Firemancer’s army.” He said. “Ah..” Ryan responded. “You mean you were at the Battle of Alderwood?” Drr asked. “No.” Flarog answered. “I was at the Firemancer’s tower at the time. Zron’s force lost, and I have been blamed ever since. However, this is the day I silence my critics.” The Fire general lifted up his gargantuan sword, the fire soldiers attacked. Ryan changed into Fire Reptile Man, and Drr transformed into a silver bear. Ryan generated two shields, one fire shield on his left arm and a Vlfirpotent shield on his right. Drr struck a fire warrior with his claw. An Inster, Inospark, flung a javelin with a red diamond head. Ryan blocked an attack with the fire shield, and struck with the Vlfirpotent shield, there was a burst of orange energy. Inospark drew a red diamond sword, he deflected a fire warrior’s blade, the Inster vaulted towards another Fire creature and redirected its attack on a Four Schools soldier. Ryan smashed his dragon tail on an armored fire creature. Four fire soldiers leaped at Ryan and battered at him with their weapons. With a silvery blaze, the four fire warriors were thrown back by Ryan’s silver fire attack. Drr leaped toward Flarog, the general signaled another fire creature to cast a black orb to the ground. Smoke filled the gateway, the fire creatures were gone.
