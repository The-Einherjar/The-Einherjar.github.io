      <h1>Reptile Man II: Hunt of the Talismans</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      Jake sat on the coach, he was at the Gibbon’s. A frozen shiver ran down Jake’s spine. Jake knew something was approaching. He wasted no time and turned into the Reptile. He stayed where he was.  Something was at the door. The door unlocked suddenly as if some device was used.  The door opened, and a robot came in. Jake shot energy. It just bounced off the robot and did nothing. “ Jake knew that the house was no place for a battle, so he ran out the door. The robot was behind him. “You shall be destroyed!” It said. It held up one of its arms. A bright beam erupted from a hole on the robot’s, wrist. It missed and hit the road.  The robot shot another  beam. Jake blocked it by generating an energy shield. “What’s going on out there?” Somebody asked. Ino erupted from the front door. “Two against one, eh?” The robot laughed. Tiny hatches opened on him and white fog came out. 
“What’s this?”  Soon the entire street was dark and surrounded by the fog. “This is a world beyond ours. It is where nightmares come from. It is called the Nightmare World.” The robot said as several smaller robots came out of the hatches. They attacked. The robot shot another beam at Ino.  Jake then attempted to create an energy tornado but because he was so slow at doing it the robot had a good opportunity to strike. Razor claws made from steel jutted from the machine’s hand he dived and punched Jake with them.. He shot a beam at Ino, the creature crashed on the ground. Jake tried invisibility, but it didn’t work. “I forgot to tell you. You can’t turn invisible in this world.” The robot laughed. Jake shot an energy fire ball. It just bounced off the machine’s armor. The robot punched Jake again. Jake crashed right next to Ino. "Now I've got you." The masterpiece of a machine said. Jake again shot an energy fireball but again it bounced off the robot’s armor. “Pathetic. You will now be destroyed, and my master will be pleased.” The robot charged up a beam. He aimed at Jake and Ino. “This will end now!” He said. A blast of energy blocked the beam. “What?” The machine roared in confusion. “I blocked your attack with one of my  arrows.” Someone in the fog said. “Who are you?” The robot demanded to know. The figure stepped into sight. It was Garry. He was carrying a weapon that looked like a bow. He also had some short of shield. He had a quiver full of round things that looked like silver. “Ino, Jake go over to the side of the road and rest. I’ll continue this fight.” He said. Ino and Jake ran over to the sidewalk where the Gibbons were. “Garry! Before you attack I must let you know: This robot cheats!” Jake said. “Be careful Garry! This guy nearly took out Jake and Ino.” Jill said. “Don’t worry. I have it under control.” Garry said. He took out a silver ball and put it into his bow. He pulled back the string and released it. The ball flew out as a laser blast. It made a loud noise when it hit the robot. When the smoke cleared the robot was gone. Suddenly a beam shot toward Garry. Garry held out his arm that did not have the bow.  An energy shield blocked the blast. The robot appeared above Garry and razor claws jutted out of the robot’s hands. Garry quickly put a silver ball in the bow and shot up. This time it hit. The robot crashed to the ground, but he did not look very damaged to Jake. Garry put the bow on his back and took out a blade. Energy surrounded the sword and. “Now you’re in for it.” Jake thought. Garry sliced the robot in half. “Yes!” Ino said. The sliced off piece connected with the other half. “What?” Both Jill and Jake said. “Allow me to explain I am made up of four parts and each can operate as individuals,  but they can also connect with the rest of my body." The robot laughed. It then shot another cutting beam. Garry shielded himself. The robot sent a shockwave which caused Garry to fall on his back. The machine held its claws over Garry. “I have won!” It declared. Before it could strike a red energy claw struck its claw. Ino had leaped back into the fray. “Right on time too.” Garry said. “How dare you interfere with my victory!” The robot roared in rage. Jake and Ino joined Ino and Garry. “Shame, I cannot stay but I will return with my master. Not that I need him to destroy you all. We will finish this soon and I will go after the Reptile Talisman, so my master could find the others and... Whoops talking too much.” It said as it flew away so fast nobody even bothered to go after it.
