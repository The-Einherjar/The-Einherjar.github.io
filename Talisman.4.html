      They were running. “I don’t remember any place like this.” Jasoner said. “Maybe we took a wrong turn.” Verderk suggested.  It was very cold and silent, there was fog.  “Let’s get out of here.” Jasoner said. “Good idea.” Osirisareses said. They ran, but there was still fog. “Where are we?” Jasoner asked. “If I knew, we would be out of here by now.” Verderk answered. It got colder, the warmth of their blood quickly went away. “I don’t like this place.” Verderk said to himself. “Join the club.” Jasoner said quietly. A footstep was heard but it stopped. “What was that?” Jasoner asked. Verderk drew a sword and looked around but the fog was too thick. “Whatever it was it is gone now...I hope.” Verderk said, nervous. They traveled around for what seemed like hours, but really it was only a few minutes when they bumped into something. It was a stone, a grave stone. ”Apparently, we are in a graveyard.” Verderk said. “Yes, but what graveyard?” Jasoner asked. He carefully read the writing on the tombs. “This is ancient rune hieroglyphics, I cannot read it.” Jasoner said. Verderk heard a sound and looked around him. “Something is coming toward us.” He said. Jasoner drew his sword and dagger. “The fog is too thick here. If we run, we might run into something we don’t want to run into, but if we stay to wait for this thing, we might get in a fight and won’t know what we are.” Jasoner stated, looking around and listening. There was a strange sound that sounded like a hyena laugh. “I think I know where we are.” Verderk said. “Where?” Jasoner asked. “The Graveyard of Heroes, a lost ancient gravesite that none rediscovered for years. This burial site contains the graves of the ancient heroes.” Verderk answered. There was another sound. “What do you think that sound is?” Jasoner asked. “I have no idea, it could be anything.” Verderk replied. “Does the term “anything“ include a figment of our imagination?” Osiriareses asked The sound got louder and louder. At the same time they got more nervous and more nervous. “I wonder if we could camouflage in Osirisareses form.” Osirisareses said to themselves. “What good would that do us?” Verderk asked pointing to himself and Jasoner. “The noise stopped.” Jasoner said. He was right, there was no sound anymore. “We must move to our destination, we have been hanging around here too long.” He added. Suddenly, something attacked from behind. Osirisareses shot a solar blast and revealed a strange creature. “Dread Zombie!” Verderk shouted. Osirisareses attacked it with his claws, the zombie regenerated. “Run!” Jasoner called out.
