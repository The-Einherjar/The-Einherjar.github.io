      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
      One of the kidnappers brought a torch. Jaclyn gave a smile of hope to Cristine that someone might come to the rescue. She smiled back. Some hope was dashed when several creatures drew near. These creatures had three arms, four eyes, two fangs, and spines on their backs. They had claws, and they were gray. They wore armor, and wielded copper weapons. “Remember our pact.” One of the figures said.
“Yes.” One of the creatures replied.
“Then let us pass.” The figure uttered.
“We were just wanting to know when you will attack.” The creature said.
“Soon.” The figure answered.
“WHEN!!?” The creature demanded.
“Our emperor shares your impatience, don’t worry” The figure said.
“My battalion is ready for combat.” The creature said.
“Our army as well, but we need to deliver the girls.” The figure replied.
One of the creatures smelled.
“What is it now?” One of the others responded. 
“Humans.” The creature said.
“Go crush.” The figure ordered.
The creatures went toward the entrance of the cave. “Where are you taking us?” Jacyln asked. “To Trulaz, where you’ll marry a couple generals.” A figure said. 
“No!” Cristine screamed.
“Remember the mountain town? Remember how you founded the republic? Well, it has been a pain and we want it’s morale to get crushed!” The figure said.
“It will never give in to the likes of you!” Jacyln declared.
“Yes, it will.” The figure said.
“I seriously think not.” Cristine said. 
“Help!!” Jaclyn shouted.
The girls were dragged, they screamed more.
<p>They heard the screams, they moved quickly. They, except for Chris and Paulius, transformed. Jasoner shifted into a wolf with sword-like claws. Suddenly, they encountered the creatures. “Gitzons!” Jake shouted, the creatures charged. The four defended themselves. Jake, Chris, and Paulius fought using swords, Paul shot orange energy. Jasoner expertly clashed with the assailants, applying use of his talons. The battle was one sided with the good guys until seven medium sized dragons showed up. “Lava Dragons!” Jake said. The Lava Dragons were red with Gitzons on top of them. Jake shot  blue-green energy, it hit a Lava Dragon, but it didn’t harm the it. Jasoner shot electricity, but the heat of the Lava Dragons blocked it. Paul clawed a dragon. There were too many. Six attacked Jasoner, he was hit by six streams of flame. He changed back. The seven focused on Paul, who was quickly brought down. This was it. Have they failed? The Gitzons on the ground charged. Jake, Chris and Paulius prepared themselves for the final few minutes.</p>
