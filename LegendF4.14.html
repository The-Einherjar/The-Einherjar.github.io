      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 14</h2>
      “You have come to stop me? Well, you will not succeed! For months, I have waited. When I marry one of the girls, I will become Lord Reqror.” General Reqror explained. He drew his blade, and swung it at Paulius, who met the sword with his own. Jake went on the attack. Reqror wasn’t Zror, and was not as hard. He leaped back and took out a bow, he shot an arrow. Missed. Jake leaped and hit with his tail, Reqror fell. He got up, angry. “You want play? We’ll play!!” He roared, his sword clashed with Jake’s. Paulius went after the elite soldiers. Jake and Reqror got in a sword lock, each pushing to gain the advantage. Suddenly, Reqror broke from it, and hit Jake’s head. Jake was knocked out. Reqror went after Paulius.
      <p>When Jake woke up he was surrounded by trees, Ryan, Trevor, Brandon, Chris, and Paulius were nearby. “What‘s going on?” Jake asked. “We are going on a mission to save Jaclyn, and Cristine, and to find out what is going on.” Trevor replied. “They got away?” Jake asked. “Yeah, I was foiled by Reqror, he knocked me on the head.” Paulius answered. “There it is.” Chris said, pointing to white light emanating behind a bush. “Time to go.” Brandon said. They all looked at the energy. ‘This is it.’ Ryan thought. They entered the gateway…</p>
      <p>They were on a plain, it was sunset. Cristine and Jaclyn were nowhere in sight, the seven were tired. “Let’s set up camp, we will be better hunters after rest.” Ryan announced. Jake turned into a reptile; he tried to get Reqror’s scent. “I think they went that way.” He said, looking east. “We’ll search that way, tomorrow.” Brandon said. They set up camp for the night.</p>
      <p>Jake, and Paulius were awake. “Paulius?” Jake asked.
“Yeah?” Pauluis asked back.
“You were here before. What happened?” Jake inquired.
“Four years ago, Cristine, Chris, Jacklyn, and I stumbled on a portal. We ended up in a village. We arrived when a sorcerer was defeated. This sorcerer had this village under his control, he was a ruthless tyrant. The people were glad he was defeated, they welcomed the four of us to their celebration of freedom. That evening, a dragon landed in the village, it was covered with white diamond. It gave as each a loose spine as a gift, our swords. It asked us to help form a republic among towns, the people of the village we were in signed a paper to join. We went. Remnants of the sorcerer’s army tried to prevent this, but it was a success.” Paulius answered.
