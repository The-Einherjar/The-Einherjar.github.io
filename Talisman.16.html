      <h2>Chapter 16</h2>
     There they were,  in the cave where they got the Vlfir. Now they were returning it. Trejakydon took Talisar and struck it down, there was an orange flash of light and then it was gone. They then went outside. “Trejakydon, thanks to you, there is peace again. We thank you.” Jasoner said. “Yes, you may go home now.” Verderk said. “You helped a lot. Shouldn’t we help repair the destruction?” Trejakydon asked. “We’ll take care of that. Your quest is over. Besides, you have your own world to protect, I have a feeling that you are needed.” Jasoner answered. “Very well, good bye. Perhaps we’ll all meet again.” Trejakydon said. He floated into the air, and as he disappeared, an image of Osirisaresses appeared as a cloud, his roar was heard as the image disappeared. “Farewell.” Verderk said. “So, the legend of the Vlfir ends.” Jasoner uttered...
    <p>They were now in Bamtou. “You have returned!” The Inster said when he saw them. Trejakydon returned Talisar to where it came from, he then separated into Trevor, Jake, Ryan, and Brandon. “We’re back!” Trevor said excitedly. The Talismans returned to their hands. “Now that the plague in the Talismans has been neutralized, you can wield them, again. You will need them, I fear that in Lynnwood, there is something wrong going on.” Inokrezidir revealed. “What’s wrong?” Ryan asked.  “There is an evil that has come. Also…I did not tell you, however, Bamtou was attacked.” Inokrezidir said. “When was this?” Jake inquired. “It preceded Zrenory’s coming to you.” The Inster answered. “What attacked?” Brandon questioned. “Not sure, something powerful must have broken through Bamtou’s defenses. There were Stouses. They extracted a fragment of the plague from the Talismans, that’s why they did not have the plague in them.” Inokrezidir made known. “Why would Stouses plan to break in Bamtou and take the plague, but not take the Talismans?” Brandon asked.  “The Talismans were locked, but they still  were able to extract what they required. As for why, we’ve been asking ourselves the same question for weeks. The Stouses and their mysterious affiliate disappeared as quick as they came. Now, we’ll investigate, Lynnwood needs you.” Inokrezider said as the four were sent back to Lynnwood. </p>
