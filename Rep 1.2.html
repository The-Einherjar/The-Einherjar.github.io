      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      <p>Jake was at the park. It was the day after the party. “Well we meet again Jake.”  “Hi, Garry how are you?” Jake said. “I’m fine” Garry said. There was an evil laugh in the air. Something appeared Grutwaq. “Remember me?” He said. “Prepare for battle!” Jake said. He and Garry moved their arms in a karate way. “I don’t have time for this.” Grutwaq said. Jake suddenly jumped, and karate chopped him. Garry then jumped kicked. Grutwaq looked like he had no pain at all. “What?” Garry said.  “Try again.” Jake ordered. He rammed into Grutwaq as hard as he can. Grutwaq did not move back a centimeter. Garry ran as fast as he can toward the menace and short of slam punch him with amazing force. That made Grutwaq tremble a bit but not much. Jake took out the talisman Grutwaq said. “Stop! Do not turn into reptile or I’ll use my powerful moves on your friend and to humans those moves will be fatal! You don’t use your powers and I don’t use mine!” Jake put the talisman back in his pocket. The two rammed as hard and fast as they can. They used all their fighting energy . Grutwaq fell on his back this time. The.  “What do you want?” Garry asked. Grutwaq took out a jar. “What is that for?” Jake asked. “This is the place were Garry will serve eternity in!” Grutwaq answered. Garry was suddenly sucked into the jar you could hear his last scream. “Garry!” Jake yelled out. Grutwaq put the jar in his pocket. “What have you done?” Jake roared. “Nothing that is your concern!” Grutwaq shot back. Jake took out his talisman. Grutwaq laughed. “You think you can beat me I’d love to stay but I need to fulfill my revenge to some people around here and you are not on my list.” Grutwaq said. But then he was gone.  “Revenge? What revenge?” Jake said. “Well I have the regretful duty to tell Mr. Gibbons what happened to his adopted brother.” Jake said. Jake started for the Gibbon’s house. When he reached the road, he saw the Gibbon’s cat. Grutwaq appeared with his jar. Jake turned into the reptile before Grutwaq could suck up the cat Jake let out a chameleon tongue. He grabbed the cat with it and pulled it to him. Grutwaq turned to them. “You better stop opposing me!” He said then vanished. Jake turned back. “The Gibbons! He is trying to get revenge on them for some reason!” Jake said. </p>
      “He said he wanted revenge on some people. He then tried to take your cat. I figured at he is after all of you.” Jake said. “What must we do?” Mallory Gibbons asked. “You must leave.” Jake said. “Where are your parents?” Jake asked. “They are at Alderwood Mall.” Jill said. “Then it is Alderwood Mall we must go.”  Caleb said.
