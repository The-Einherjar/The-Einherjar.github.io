    <h1>Reptile Man IV: The Flames of Rorzron</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
      They flew to a high spot, in front of them was a large wall with ancient writings. “The Wall of Rorzron.” Gost said. “There are so many sections.” Troy said. “The gem.” Gost uttered. Gost took the gem and held it up. The gem glowed with lightning, at the same time, a small section of the wall glowed and fell to the ground. Troy picked it up and put it in a bag. They then went to the edge of the path they were on. Below, were thousands of Stouses and at least fifty lava dragons flew. In the middle of the caverns was a huge shape that was neither Stouse or lava dragon, it looked like a dragon and had two gigantic wings, it was black with smoke encircling it, and it had five mouths, one on every side of its titanic head, it also had teeth that looked as if they were great curved swords. A long-forked tongue came out of the center mouth. Its tail was at least fifty feet long. “A Dread Lizard!” Gost said. “A what?” Danny asked. “A Dread Lizard, an ancient creature of Growun, immensely powerful. Getting back will not be an easy.” Gost affirmed. Troy, Richard, Danny, and Jill and David drew their weapons. Ryan, Jake, Trevor, and Brandon as well as Gost were still in their talisman forms. “Now!” Gost commanded. They hurried down. Stouses came charging, Gost and the others continued. Without warning, the lava dragons and the Stouses stopped charging. They had an aversion to something ahead. “There is the pit of Yuguzalut.” Ryan said pointing to the great hole with smoke coming out. They went towards it, Suddenly, they heard a roar behind them, the Dread Lizard. Gost went towards it. “Keep going, I’ll distract it.” He said. The Dread Lizard looked at him and laughed in a roar. Jake, Ryan, Trevor, and Brandon went towards it as well. The Dread Lizard attacked Gost with its jaws. Gost shot acid, the massive lizard roared. Gost then brought out the needles from his four arms and sliced the Dread Lizard with them. The lizard shot a fireball, this was blocked by Ryan getting in the way. The lizard took its great tail and struck at Ryan, causing him to fly into Gost. It then struck at the other three. Before it could finish them off, they glowed, and a light struck them and lit the cavern. When the light was gone a great creature stood in their place, it was Osirisareses the Great dragon. “We may yet have hope of escape.” Gost said. “I definitely remember this guy.” Jill said. Osirisareses shot a fire stream at the Dread Lizard. The lizard roared and shot its own. The two started to battle, the Dread Lizard shot fire and used its tail and teeth while Osirisareses seemed unharmed, he kept on shooting fireballs. “Come on, you have better attacks then that, now's not the time to mess around.” Jill groaned. "Oh,sorry." Osirisareses chuckled. The dragon shot his great ice blast, the lizard was frozen but broke out of the ice. The lizard stood up on two of its legs and roared with flames and smoke showing in its mouth, it shot a large flame from all its mouths, causing the fire to encircle the entire space they were fighting in. Osirisareses shot his thorns and wrapped them around the dreadful creature, then pulled him over and ducked. The lizard was sent flying towards the pit of Yuguzalut, it fell in roaring. Its roar continued, but became more silent every second. This kept on going until it stopped. Before the Stouses could charge again, Osirisareses turned into his four human forms and slipped with the rest through the exit of the caverns.
    <p>“You have the Wall of Rorzron?” The principle asked. “Part of it.” Gost answered.. “What does it say?” Troy asked. “I can barely read these letters, but it reads that the gem was created as a leash for the Firemancers, Zron wants to destroy it! The sorcerer who forged the three Firemancers forged the gem to leash them because he feared they would rebel. Without the gem, Zron’s power would truly be unleashed. In fact, he would be almost unstoppable.” Gost explained. “I say we gather our full forces from underground and hold off Zron’s attacks.” David said. “We cannot win that way, Zron and Xroyadrick, who you said is helping him, will keep on attacking us with large numbers. We have a limited number of forces, who knows if the first attack will finish us off.” Ryan said. “How is Cyport?” Jake inquired. Gost sighed. “Battery is still off. I don’t know when he will be operational again.” Gost said. “We could attack his forces before he attacks us.” Trevor said. “Bad idea, we don’t know how many minions he has at his base, and that will leave everything unprotected.” Brandon said. “We could always surrender.” Trevor said. “Very funny.” The principle said.</p>
