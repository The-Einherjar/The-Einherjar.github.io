      “So Ryan, do you still have the Fire Talisman?” Brian asked. “Of course I do.” Ryan replied. Ryan, Trevor, Brandon and Jake were playing a board game they created. “How do you play this game?” Garry asked. “I have no idea. All I know is ever since they received their Intsers, they gone crazy about creating a game where the talismans are waging war on each other.” Jill said. Recently after Grutwaq’s defeat, thousands of Ino’s kind came and told them that they would fight whenever there was a crisis, and they divided themselves into four groups. One group for each talisman bearer. Now the four wanted to battle each other, except not in an actual war. “Who is winning?” Brian asked. “I am.” Ryan said after he moved his pieces. “Your base Brandon...is mine!” He declared. “What? That’s impossible. My base can’t be conquered.” Brandon said. “It just was.” Jake said. “Come on. By now I could have beaten all four of you together. You four couldn’t win a war if your lives depended on it.” Brian said. At that exact moment, a red flash appeared over the Olympic Mountains, even though nobody noticed.
      <p>Gost looked like he was about to leave. “Leaving already?” Mallory asked. “No, I also thought I should tell you a quick story I heard once.”</p>
      <p>“One and a half thousand years ago, there was a sorcerer of terrible power. He and the order of wicked knights gathered mercenaries to wage war on the entire world. Something was missing in his army, something powerful to lead their armies and destroy. He took three black gems, and forged three beasts: The Firemancers, Crozet the Quick One, Xroyadrick, the Impatient One, and Zron the Powerful One. Terrible was the destruction of the Firemancers, but the other side was desperate. They asked four great reptiles for help. One of these great beasts was the last great dragon; another was the last of the Blue Hydras, the third was a sea serpent, and the fourth was a giant two headed asp. After a confrontation, Crozet was defeated, but the four reptiles were also defeated. The sorcerer died, and the Firemancers disappeared...</p>
      Well it is getting late, better go. See you in class.” Gost said. Little did they know Gost’s story was about to change their lives forever...
