“Right.” Mr. Gibbons said, turning off his cell phone. He and his family were in a forest. He was talking to Mr. Schwab, he previously called his adopted brother, Garry. Around his family, and him, were hundreds of silver armored soldiers. They were from the ancient civilization of Kzat. “Well?” Mrs. Gibbons asked. “They’re going to launch the operation as soon as possible, I agreed to help.” He said. “Are we going, then?” A warrior asked. “Yes, better start now.” Mr. Gibbons answered. “Yes, we weren’t ready last time, but now it is time to defend our homes.” The warrior agreed. They had prepared for war since the Battle of Alderwood.
      <p>Zror and his generals were at a table. “General Monstrost, you will lead an advance army to take the fortress of Luris Coldras.” Zror ordered. “Yes, my emperor.” A figure in gold and red armor said. “Then, when it is captured, we will march on Luris Coldor, take it before morning, and then the wedding will occur. Monstrost, I am giving you three hundred thousand soldiers.” Zror said. “What if the Legendary Hero comes?” Monstrost asked. “I am giving you one thousand elite soldiers, for each of them.” Zror answered. “Them?” Monstrost asked. “Yes, four of them. That will give you four thousand elites.” Zror said. That satisfied Monstrost. “I want all citizens to witness the wedding, as much publicity as we can get.” Zror ordered. “What about the three thousand soldiers you sent away?” Reqror asked. “Top secret. Now, prepare to attack now! We have only this day and the night.” Zror said.</p>
      <p>Zror entered the coach Cristine and Jacyln were in. “Tomorrow, is the wedding.” He announced. “What if we say: “I do not.”, tomorrow?” Cristine asked. “We’ll see to it, that we succeed.” Zror answered, he left the coach. “We have to get out of here.” Jaclyn said. “Yes.” Cristine responded. The coach started to move. The march continued. “Any ideas?” Jaclyn asked. “I will think.” Cristine replied.</p>
