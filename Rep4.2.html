    <h1>Reptile Man IV: The Flames of Rorzron</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      There was a red flash earlier that no one noticed if you remember, and it came from the Olympic Mountains. A red flash over there is a bad sign. A very bad sign. In fact, Rorzron which was the ancient empire of the dread lord Growun, was in the Olympic Mountains. Indeed there was something there that was going terribly wrong.
      <p>Among these mountains, was the ancient Mons Surprem, the fortress of Growun. Inside was ancient rooms with the weapons of Growun’s armies, however, they would not likely be recognized as weapons since they short of turned to fossils. In the center of the rocky fortress was a pit, there were two Stouses, which are half human half spider creatures. They were arguing on who should rule Rorzron. Since Growun was gone, they wanted a new leader to attack their enemies. “I want to be the boss!” One said. “No, you’ll mess both of us up!” The other said. “Wait a minute, how can we bring Rorzron up to its former glory if there are only two of us?” The other asked. “It was your idea to came here in the first place!” The other one said. “Well, you wanted to reform the Rorzron empire!” They continued to argue and did not pay attention to what they were doing. “At least I got this fancy black gem, very nice.” One of them said. “I want it, give it to me!” The other said trying to grab it. He missed and instead hit it and caused it to fall in the pit. A large fiery hand with claws came out. An earthquake shook the ground and a huge figure flew out of the pit. It was at least thirty feet tall and had two fiery wings and a long spiky tail. Its face was blocked by smoke, the tail was long and skinny, it was more like a whip then a tail. He did not have any legs, instead he had tentacles to keep him standing, not squid tentacles, but armored, serpent like, gas was coming out of them and burning as it went up. As he moved his head showed. It had two fiery eyes, its mouth was like a dragon’s. Above the eyes was a red diamond horn. The giant beast looked down at the two Stouses. “I am Zron, the Powerful One. Who are you?” The two did not answer. “Who are you two, and when am I?” He asked again. “Leave now Zron! Or whoever you claim to be, this is Growun’s realm!” One of the Stouses yelled out. “I’m taking over this realm to finish what my master started.” Zron said. The two Stouses huddled together to talk in secret. “Now we have two choices: die or be enslaved?” One said. “Well, enslaved is not what I’d say. Serving this guy might lead to a reward. He wants to conquer this realm. I think if we let him be our leader we could bring Rorzron back to its former glory.” The other said. They turned to Zron. “We agree.” One of them said. “Excellent.” Zron said. “Now, this mountain is old, let’s build a tower next to it.” He said. A few thousand skeletons like creatures appeared. “Build me a fortress.” Zron ordered. It took a few hours but the skeleton things worked quickly. They brought up an impressive tower. It was built into the side of Mons Surprem, the skeletons built an iron wall around it with a heavy gate and catapults mounted to it. “Fortress is done, now for the army.” Zron said. He began to summon creatures, more skeletons, orange creatures, and then he summoned his power hitters, the Fire. Fiery shapes with fire swords, axes. They came from an enormous empire deep inside the earth. Then, he called the Zorraiders, the stone knights the sorcerer was of. He mustered tens of thousands. Suddenly, the two Stouses, who were next to him noticed something. Zron turned around and saw a fiery shape coming towards him. It was a fireball that changed shape as it moved. It stopped, eyes that were like Zron’s appeared. A shape like Zron, materialized. “Greetings, my old brother, I am Xroyadrick, the Impatient One.” It said in an echoing voice. “Yes, I remember you brother” Zron said. “I have been around for a while and suffered a defeat, my remaining forces and my newly summoned forces are here right now.” Xroyadrick said. Zron looked out of his tower again and saw dark shapes next to his fortress. “I thought you would help me defeat my new enemies.” Xroyadrick said. “I am preparing to launch an assault upon this realm. I am not yet ready, remember patience.” Zron said. Xroyadrick seemed enraged at the very word. “Patience! I waited long enough, and now I want war!” He said. “I am Zron, the Powerful One, I know how to crush my enemies. First, you build an army of great power and make them huge in number, then unleash them and your enemy will be overwhelmed. I am doing it and you should do the same.” Zron said. “Very well.” Xroyadrick said grumbling. “Where is your gem?” Zron asked. “I have it.” Xroyadrick said, next to him was a black gem, he was carrying with fiery talons. “We should demolish them.” Zron said, he noticed something, his gem was missing. “No! Where is it?” He bellowed. Xroyadrick looked out the tower, about one hundred flying creatures with chariots behind each of them were coming their way, they held up banners. “That’s the banners of my enemies!” Xroyadrick exclaimed. The riders on the chariots shot arrows at the fortress. “Repel them!” Zron ordered. His forces started to fire catapults and arrows at the attackers. The riders dodged them and kept firing their arrows. “Fire!” One of the Stouses said. Fifty arrows were shot from a lower part of the tower and hit a couple of the flying creatures that were pulling the chariots. The riders jumped on other chariots as their own crashed to the ground. “Send the Zorraiders.” Zron ordered. The second Stouse blew a horn. Out from the center part of the tower flew the knights and their dragons. They went after the chariots. One of the chariot riders hid, he saw something on the ground, it was a black gem. The rider grabbed it and took his bow and shot at a Zorraider. The arrow bounced off the stone figure. The Zorraider chased the chariot, but it and the chariot force vanished from sight. “I saw your missing gem.” A Zorraider said in a cold voice. “Where?” Zron asked.</p>
