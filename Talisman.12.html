      <h1>Talisman IV</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
     Trejakydon took a deep breath before he entered the cave. When he was inside, Talisar flew out of the cave and landed on the ground. Trejakydon separated into Ryan, Trevor, Brandon, and Jake. Talisar glowed and the four Talismans flew out and into the four teenager’s hands. They tried to get Talisar back, but there was some barrier spell or something that blocked the entrance to the cave. “That happened.” Ryan uttered. They continued on, they stopped when some gigantic candles suddenly lit on fire. They were now in a big chamber. A figure approached them, he looked human, except his arms were made out of silver and he had a long reptile tail, he looked like a teenager. “Greetings, I am Trillidron. I know why you came. So, let’s get down to business, shall we? First, here is how the battles will go, so pay attention: each of you will fight me individually. I will turn myself into a terrifying creature, then I will fight one of you. When my form runs out of energy, I will turn into something else and fight another one of you. This will continue until a winner is decided. “I will fight you first.” Jake said. “Excellent, Let the challenge begin!” Trillidron declared. Jake activated his Talisman and turned into Reptile Man. Trillidron turned into a reptile creature that stood on all fours, it was dark green with razor sharp teeth.  Its tongue was over ten feet long, its tail was like a ten-foot  whip, on the creature’s back were two wings, each of the scales had as sharp spine on it. Trillidron leaped at Jake, but missed. Jake leaped out of the way and camouflaged. Trillidron started to shoot lightning out of his mouth in an attempt to locate Jake. Reptile Man turned visible behind Trillidron back and locked his jaws on one of the wings. This lasted until he was hit with a tail strike. Trillidron took to the air and shot more lightning. Jake charged energy and shot it at Trillidron’s head. After Trillidron was hit, he fell to the ground. Jake struck his with claws. Trillidron got up and shot lightning again, this time Jake was hit. Trillidron unleased his tongue, whitch was surrounded with lightning. Jake let out a  plasma blast. Trillidron turned back into himself, Jake did the same. “First round. Who is next?” Trillidron asked. “I am.” Brandon said. He turned into Lord of The Oaks, Trillidron turned into a giant wasp with large pinchers on two arms. Trillidron charged, he stung Brandon. To Brandon’s surprise, it hurt. He quickly grabbed Trillidron with his thorns. In seconds, the giant wasp was tangled in briars. Nonetheless, the wasp wouldn’t give up, he kept on buzzing his wings. His pinchers cut the vines “Ouch! Why you little!” Brandon shot solar blasts, but missed. The wasp laughed out loud. Brandon took this opportunity to do the most unexpected thing, he leaped as high as he was able and slammed into Trilldron with great force. The wasp crashed to the ground. The two turned back into their normal forms. “I win.” Brandon said. “I am next.” Trevor said, he turned into Fish Master, and Trillidron turned into a giant crab with a scorpion tail and a mouth full of venomous snake fangs. Trevor quickly froze the tail with ice and rammed into the mouth with his horn. Trillidron pulled Trevor out with his claw. Trevor froze Trillidron’s mouth and the other claw. Trillidron hit Trevor to the ground. Trevor used his own claws to release himself from Trillidron’s grip. He then froze Trillidron completely. The two of them turned back into their normal selves. “Final round.” Trillidron said. Ryan turned into Fire Reptile Man, Trillidron turned into a red serpent-like  dragon with fire surrounding him. Ryan shot fire, and so did Trillidron. The fire blasts didn’t do anything to either of them. Trillidron tried to bite, but Ryan generated a fire shield. Fire Reptile Man then formed a fire tornado and sent it toward Trillidron. The flying serpent clawed through it and slashed at Ryan, who shot a silver and gold fire cyclone, his secret attack. It hit the ceiling and caused rocks to fall on Trillidron. The two changed back. “You win. One of the most important cities that oppose the sorcerer, is about to be attacked by thousands of the sorcerer’s giants. That is something the city cannot handle. If you want to defeat the sorcerer, you must stop this attack.” Trillidron said, he disappeared. The four went out of the cave and picked up Talisar. They fused into Trejakydon.
    <p>“That was quite the experience.” Trejakydon said. “You defeated Trillidron?” Willius inquired. “He is defeated. He also said that the sorcerer is about to attack a very important city.” Trejakydon said. “Luris Coldor?” Willius asked. “I don’t know, he said that if we are to defeat the sorcerer, then we must first stop him.” Trejakydon said. “We will move out and stop him, then.” Willius said. “I can get there fast and take some with me.” Trejakydon offered. “How?” Willius asked. Trejakydon turned into Osirisareses. “Very well, then. I will send some of my best men with you.” Willius said. After about ten minutes Verderk, Jasoner, and seven rebel soldiers were on Osirisareses’s back. They took off. </p>
