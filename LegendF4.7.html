     The Gibbons were friends. They answered the call. “Hello?” Mr. Gibbons said. “Okay, I’ll put it on speakerphone.” He said. Jake told them about the whole thing. “It is without a doubt that we have a destiny to fight evil, we can run from it, or we could choose to fight evil. We always have a choice. I know you will fight, we will come fast.” Mr. Gibbons commented. “Thank you. Bye.” Jake hung up. “Hmmm…” Jill, Mr. Gibbon’s second oldest said. “Let’s prepare.” Caleb the fourth oldest said. “Yes.” Said Shaley, the fifth. “Has anyone seen my bow?” Brianna, the third oldest asked. Tegan, the youngest went, then came and handed Brianna her bow. “Thank you.” Brianna thanked. Soon the house was noisy. “You ready?” Mallory, the eldest asked. “Yep.” Jill answered.
      <p>“The emperor will be here in about five minutes.” General Reqror said.
</p>
      <p>“Then we could take back the two girls.” Another general said.</p>
      <p>“Jasoner, eh?” General Reqror asked.</p>
      <p>“Yes, General.” A cloaked thing said.</p>
      <p>“Hmm. Jasoner has interfered for the last time.” Reqror replied.</p>
      <p>“Let’s mobilize.” The other general ordered. “By the time the emperor arrives, we will be ready to go.”</p>
      <p>Someone blew a horn. The entire camp formed ranks, there were tons of creatures in gold and red armor. There were archers, swords, spears, axes, catapults, cavalry, not horses but dragons, and reptilelike boars. “Now is the beginning of the end, of Earth.” General Reqror laughed.</p>
