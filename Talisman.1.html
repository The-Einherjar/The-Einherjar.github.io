      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      In the deep depths of a world outside the Earth, this realm was a transcendent energy. It was said that whoever wielded this would become the most powerful sorcerer in the land, they would wield power beyond the kings of the nations.
      <p>Once upon a time, a king of the domain called Trulor, heard of this ancient power. He sent his soldiers forth and him with them, hoping to claim it. He went from village to village, outside his own kingdom and asked where this energy was. Some gave him information and joined his dark kingdom. However, some refused to tell him, and some knew nothing. These, their towns the king destroyed and enslaved the citizens. Many other kings tried to stop him, but their attempts were in vain. The nations fell to the Trulor empire, but one king, Lurel’di, amassed all the heroes that remained, and he and his remaining soldiers of his tired, weakened, but desperate army marched toward the Canyon of Red Sunsets to confront the armies of Trulor, who were very close to the power. There, in the red sunset, was the battle to determine the fate of the realm. After a long a terrible battle that lasted several hours that seemed like years, the red sunset was down, and there was the darkness of the night. The Trulor forces had fallen. Some fell to the dust, and the remaining ones either ran to the dessert, trial for war crimes, or they were captured. The others ran to live in caves for the rest of their lives. The ones who ran to the dessert were never heard from again. As for the king of Trulor, he lost an arm during the battle, and was captured. Lurel’di was killed in the battle and his son Lurel’ar, became king, many of the judges of the nation suggested that the king of Trulor should be executed. However, Lurel’ar was sorrowful of the war’s desolation. In this nation, it was the king who made the final decision for the fate of the convicted. The king of Trulor was banished in the ice-cold mountains, north of Trulor. Some say this was too lenient. Some say otherwise. Nonetheless, peace was restored.</p>
      <p>Many centuries passed, and the legendary energy  remained undisturbed and quiet. However,  people were growing nervous because of the increased crime rate. There was rumor that a dark power in the north east was growing.  So, it was, in the Northern Mountains, which was changing from an extremely cold climate to becoming darker. In the inner parts, it was becoming less cold, the outside however, was becoming unbearably cold, and nobody seemed to want to cross it. No one knew of what was happening at the center of the rocky range. A powerful sorcerer was gaining power, many near the mountain feared it was the old king of Trulor, more said it was impossible for him to survive that long. The sorcerer was mustering forces, many creatures from Trulor and the great dessert. The cavemen from the Canyon of Red Sunset dared to cross the cold mountains. The sorcerer put them in his armies and many thousands he mutated. Rumor of him started to grow and many feared that he would attempt to claim the energy again. Many went to the Legendary Heroes, who were only a few in number, but were alive since the days of the war of the Red Sunsets. The Legendary Heroes were old and were barely able to fight, and were unable to save the people.</p>
      <p>Many years passed, the Legendary Heroes were all dead and buried with full honor. At this point, the sorcerer sent his forces and started war. Many nations quickly fell to his powerful armies of destruction, and many other nations were under siege. Trulor was back under his command and his power increased with every victory.</p>
      <p>However, things would soon change, for a hero would soon be sent...</p>
