    <h1>Reptile Man IV: The Flames of Rorzron</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
      It has been a day since the thing came and Troy found the gem. One of his teachers who saw the event was curious, the teacher’s name was Gost He decided to pay Troy a little visit during lunch. “Troy, can I have a word with you for a minute?” He asked. “Sure.” Troy said. “Follow me.” Gost said. When they were in his classroom, Gost began speaking. “Can I see that gem you found?” He asked. “Okay.” Troy said, he was surprised that Gost knew about it. He put his hand in his pocket, took the gem out and handed it to Gost. Gost looked at it closely, he held it west toward the Olympic Mountains. The gem started to glow, and lighting was flashing inside of it. Gost instantly pulled it back. “A great ancient power that has not been heard from in one thousand and a half years, is rising in the Olympic Mountains. That was, at least what I thought. Now my suspicions have been proven, this is no ordinary gem, it belongs to Zron, the Powerful One, the first of the two surviving Firemancers.” Gost said. “I don’t understand, what’s a Firemancer?” Troy asked. “It’s a long story, I’ll tell it to you later.” Gost said. He looked at the gem. We need to hold a meeting, the sooner the better.” Gost said. “You can go back to lunch.” He added.
      <p>Each of the four Schools sent at least one ambassador. Lynnwood had three however: Ryan, Jill and Troy. Mountlake Terrace sent two: Jake and David Fazio. Meadowdale sent one whose name was Danny. And Edmonds Woodway sent one who was named Richard. It also took a while to get the council started, but it started. “Now we can actually start the committee.” Gost said. Everyone stared at him. “Okay, then all of you know of that fortress in the Olympic Mountains, right?” He asked. “Yes, someone from our school named Cody sent an attack force to attack it.” David said. “Quick question, where are all these forces coming from?” Jill asked. “I don’t know exactly where, but from what I heard, they are creatures from underground, they were driven here by the Fire, who conquered a large amount of the underground parts.” Gost answered. “Cody’s attack I heard weakened some of Zron’s defenses of his tower now he has to replace them and then replace the creatures in his armies that he transferred to the tower defense plus he is not ready to attack yet. This gives us time.” He said. “You do not know things that Mountlake Terrace never mentioned. Deep inside our school, an evil was rising and was secretly building a small but powerful attack force under our school. We found out, and we with armies from underground attacked . At the end of the fight, we found out that the perpetrator was one of the Firemancers, Xroyadrick, the Impatient One. At least I think that was his name. Before we could question him he vanished.” David revealed. “So, Cody and his attack force shadowed him, and came across Zron’s forces. There was a battle, and one of the chariot soldiers found a gem, which somehow came here, and fell on Troy’s head.” Gost surmised, tossing the gem on the table. ”This is being hunted by Zron’s forces. A Zorraider attacked us a few days ago. Zron knows we have it and will do anything to get it.” Gost said. “Why” Danny asked. “I wish I knew more about this gem.” Gost said, trying to think. “Wait a minute, we can get the information from the Wall of Rorzron. Growun, I’ll bet he wrote something on the Wall of Rorzron. Somebody can go to the wall, find the information and get it here.” He stated. “But, wouldn’t that mean going into the caverns in Mount St. Helens?” Ryan asked. “Indeed, it means that.” Gost answered. “That cavern has thousands of those half spider, half human things and those lava dragons… and The Pit of Yuguzalut.” Jake said. “It is the only way, I’m afraid. I’ll go, I been in those caverns and I saw the Wall of Rorzron.” Gost said. “I’ll come.” Troy said, “I shall go also, like it or not.” Jill said declared. “Very well, but under one condition, I go with you.” Jake said. “I’m going too.” Danny said. “So am I.” Richard added. “Hey, I’m coming!” Said a voice, it was Trevor. “Jake, Ryan you two aren’t going anywhere without us.” Brandon said as he and Trevor entered the room. “I might as well go with you as well.” David said. “Very well then, it has been settled we meet here five o’ clock in the morning tomorrow, and one more thing bring weapons or you will be left behind, I assure you.” Gost said.</p>
