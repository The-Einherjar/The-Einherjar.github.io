      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 25</h2>
      Ryan gazed down at the map, by all accounts, Zror’s army had fallen back to Trulor. Zror himself, had not reappeared. The Four Schools had fully mobilized, their forces numbered 614,000, and the Gibbons had come with 20,000 Kzat soldiers. In addition to the Four Schools, there were more schools that were guarded by creatures. Nearly two years after the defeat of Zron, the Firemancer, a Zorraider emerged from the subterranean realms with an army of Firelings and Shadowlings. The stone knight took control of Zron’s tower from the Four Schools, intending to finish what the band of wicked knights started. Cody and his flying chariots mounted a rescue of the survivors on the top of the tower. The Four Schools marshalled a large force to retake the fortress, flying siege artillery to the mountains and ferrying troops across the sound. The swiftness of the Alliance of the Four School’s response had been impressive, but in the mountains they were attacked by a force of Stouses and Gitzons. They were from Umios Tretut, Mount St. Helens. The army of the Four Schools was trounced, they evacuated across the water. The forces of Umios Tretut and the Zorraider had joined in an alliance, they and the Four Schools assembled fleets on the sound. Months of naval blockade commenced. In the Cascade Mountains, Gitzons and Stouses allied with Umios Tretut invaded other clans of Stouses, even raiding farms near the mountains. Immediately, schools to the north of the Four Schools mounted a defense of the assailed Stouses. The foe’s offensive halted. The conflict continued with schools to the south aiding in the coalition of the Four Schools, the northern schools, and allied Stouse clans. The Four Schools and the forces of Umios Tretut continued the naval arms race until the forces of Umios Tretut kicked off a colossal sea and land assault, the massive Battle of Bainbridge materialized on the sound. Suddenly, a horn echoed, a fleet appeared, Kzatian, with Mr. Gibbons, wielding the Sword of Zat. The Umios Tretut fleet was defeated, they fell back to Rorzron. The coalition forces advanced towards Mons Surprem, a large number of Umios Tretut warriors surrendered. Mr. Gibbons fought the Zorraider, and after a clash, the stone knight’s army was overcome. The following morning, the southern schools and the allied clans defeated Umios Tretut’s allies at Snoqualmie.

”Captain Ryan!” A creature exclaimed. ”Yes, Drr?” Ryan inquired. “Scouts have detected a force of the Fire approaching in battle deployment.” The creature said. Ryan took his sword, he, Drr, and a number of creatures proceeded to the school’s underground citadel.
