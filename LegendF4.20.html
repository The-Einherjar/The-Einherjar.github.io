      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 20</h2>
     The seven were waiting, it was quiet. They were watching the Trulor force. It was night, and it was somewhat cloudy. Suddenly, the enemy halted. In the front, there were creatures clad in dark armor, with red eyes; they were mounted on reptile boars. There were also big soldiers mounted on reptile boars, they had big axes. Behind them, there were lightly armored winged creatures, their armor was gray steel, so was the big soldier’s armor. The winged creatures wielded spears, they had snakelike fangs, and heads were like that of bats. The seven couldn’t see much of the big mounted creatures, but they saw huge fangs. Behind the flying creatures there were ranks of creatures that had steel hue armor, wielded swords, spears, and bows. “Those are the emperor’s elites. They are among the deadliest creatures of his empire. They are highly trained. They are called: “The Elites of Zror”.” Jasoner said. Behind the elites, were big creatures that were not mounted, and behind them, were red and gold armored soldiers. “Be careful with the dark riders, too. They are Elite Trulor Cavalry, not as skilled of The Elites of Zror, but they are cunning.” Jasoner added. A few catapults were being set up. “Not this time!” The captain of the fort shouted. “Fire!” He instructed, the catapults in the fort shot large stones that hit and destroyed the enemy catapults. A war horn blew, the big mounted creatures charged at the gate. “Archers, aim!” The fortress captain directed. The archers aimed at the incoming creatures. “Fire!” The captain shouted when they were close enough. The sound of bow strings filled the fort. Though some creatures were hit and fell to the ground the charge did not stop. Ryan, Jake, Trevor, and Brandon transformed and fired their attacks. Jasoner transformed into the giant wolf and shot electric energy. When the riders reached the gate, they used their axes to hit the wooden door. The giant crossbows fired. The flying creatures took off into the air, Ryan shot a fireball at one, it fell, his was followed by thistles from Brandon, ice shards from Trevor, and energy blasts from Jake. The creatures attacked the wall, the first melee combat occurred. Willius blocked a spear with his sword; Paulius and Chris were fighting the flying creatures with their swords. A spear hit Chris in the shoulder, but thanks to the armor he had on, it did not harm him. Ryan’s sword glowed orange, he swung it, an orange energy wave hit several flying creatures. Trevor froze the creatures that were striking their axes at the gate. The fighting with the flying creatures continued for several minutes, by then wooden ladders were there, and the Elites of Zror were climbing them. Trevor froze a ladder, and Ryan tipped it over. They tipped more ladders, but were unable to tip them all before The Elites of Zror made it. Their focus seemed to be the four Talisman wielders. The four young men, their swords glowing orange, defended themselves. Brandon used his vines to strike an elite with his sword, from a distance. He then shot thistles at incoming flying creatures. Jake was in a sword lock with one of Zror’s elites. The elite pulled back, and grabbed his spear; Jake swung his tail, and knocked the spear away. The elite tried to slash Jake, but Jake slashed him first. The battle lasted half an hour, then there were war horns. The attack was put to an abrupt end. There was another army, much larger. Zror walked out of it toward a creature in gold and red armor. Zror looked angry. The young men could hear him. “How incompetent, I give you three hundred thousand, including one thousand elites for each of the four heroes, and still you have not captured Luris Coldras, a puny little fortress.” He said. “Let me continue the attack.” The general requested. “No, I want to take Luris Coldor by sunrise.” Zror said. “You better hope you do not fail me during that.” The armies marched past the fortress.
Trevor saw a coach surrounded by Zror’s Elites, it had giant crossbows. “That must be where they are, the girls.” He said. “We must assist the forces of Luris Coldor.” Jasoner said. “How? We just can’t leave the woman and children here.” A soldier replied. “We’ll go, me, Jake, Brandon, Ryan, Trevor, and Paulius.” Chris replied. “I’ll go.” Jasoner said. “How about us?” A voice asked. A mantis-like creature flew inside Luris Coldras. “Inoiker?” Jake asked. “Us?” Ryan asked. Inoiker led Ryan, Jake, Trevor, Brandon, Chris, Paulius, and Jasoner out of the fortress. There was a company of charioteers. The chariots were bronze colored, and pulled by horse-sized dark gray lizards. The soldiers were wearing bronze colored armor, they wielded great bows, spears, and swords. There were twenty-five chariots. Each was one manned by three, they were big enough for five. “Time to go.” Jake said. The eight jumped into chariots, they took off, Jasoner ran with them. “It was decided to send an expeditionary force.” Inoiker said. He sent a hawk with a message. “How many do you have?” Trevor asked. “The Four Schools have sent Seventy-Five Thousand.” Inoiker said. ”We are dealing with around eight hundred thousand.” Jake explained. “I estimate Luris Coldor has around four hundred thousand.” Jasoner said.
