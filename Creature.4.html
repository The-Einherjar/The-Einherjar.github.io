      <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
  Drr took cover under a truck. Fire was spreading throughout the city, cars were flying through the air because of the force of the wind. The city was under attack by a dragon, it was purple, and was one hundred feet long with a tail with thorns, the wings were three times more massive. The dragon was shooting purple blasts at buildings, while the wings caused the wind to send cars flying. At Lynnwood High School, the army from underground, that fought against the Firemancers, were preparing for battle against the beast. Drr was preparing to attack the dragon, as well. Suddenly, three energy spheres appeared in the air, and flew into a direction. They went all the way to Min Su and the others.

Zriqron flew into view and shot a fire stream at the dragon of Grutwaq. This distracted it, the other two Talisman Dragons flew around the dragon and attacked. Zriqron flew next to the four. “Allow me to teach you something, how to fuse without all four Talismans.” He said. Ryan took off into the air in his Talisman form, on his back was an  ice warrior with a large branch-like arm. Jake turned into a  he took and struck the dragon of Grutwaq with his claw. Ryan, and the three Talisman Dragons each shot a fire stream at it and the ice warrior leaped at it, the branch glowed white.
