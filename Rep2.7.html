      <h1>Reptile Man II: Hunt of the Talismans</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
      “I hope they aren’t going this way.” Jake said. “It is highly unlikely my brother knows were the talismans are, so he is probably trying to figure out where I would put them.” Ino said. “There it is, the forest.” Jake said. The vehicles all stopped. everyone got out. “Take your weapons, or whatever you have with you.” Ino said. “Okay.” Ryan responded. They all got their weapons, and went into the forest. It was midnight, so they took flashlights. “Where is it?” Trevor asked. “Ahead, under a pyramid shaped rock.” Ino answered. Troy aimed his flashlight at a bush, there was a stone with words on it. “Hey there is a rock with writings on it. I can’t read it.” He said. “I can.” Ino said. “Here lies twenty of our best warriors.” He read. “Native American warriors are buried in this spot.” Troy said. “What in the state of Washington did this? A bear or cougar can’t kill twenty just like that.” Ryan said. “Whatever it is, it is in this forest.” Brandon said. “There, the talisman, right over there!” Ino said Brandon went over to it. Suddenly, a loud screeching noise came from the trees. A giant creature that looked like a scorpion, landed on the ground. Jake turned into a reptile. Garry drew his sword. Jake jumped on top of the scorpion’s tail, and clamped his jaws around it. Ryan shot a cutting shockwave rat the scorpion’s head, this made some damage, but not much. Michael threw his axe and spear, both hit one of the scorpion’s claws. Trevor slowed the creature down with his gravity generator. Ino came over, and clawed the creature. Jake then shot lightning, and jumped off the tail. The electricity went down the tail, and fried the entire body of the scorpion. However, the battle was not over yet. Brandon shot a yellow energy beam. The scorpion was on the ground. Makaio finished it by stabbing the samurai sword into the scorpion’s head. Brandon went over to the rock and picked it up, there was a fat round small stone with the carving of a tree on it. “The Plant Talisman.” Trevor said. “One down, two to go.” Ino said. “Yes!” Garry said. “Now, we have two talismans. The Reptile Talisman, which belongs to Jake, and the Plant Talisman which belongs to Brandon.” Ino said.
<p>When they arrived at Edmonds, Ino told everybody that the talisman was one mile from the shore. They went on a ferry, suddenly a strange sound shook the boat. “What was that?” Jake asked. “I don’t now, but there are several strange submerged objects, and they are moving toward us.” Ryan said. “They are small. There are about fifty of them at least. “They are trying to break through.” Garry knocked an arrow, and loaded it into his bow. Jake turned into a Reptile, and Brandon turned into his talisman creature. Makaio drew his sword, and Michael took his axe.  A weird amphibian like creature with a dagger, and scuba diver gear leaped on the ferry. Brandon figured they must have stolen diver gear from the bottom. Garry shot the laser arrow. The creature fell to the ground, Garry knocked another arrow. Just then, about twenty bounded on at the same time. Jake shot blasts defeating some, but more took their place. Makaio charged at them, and Michael did the same. Brandon, Jake, and Garry did backup. Garry shot laser arrows, Brandon fired solar heat waves, and Jake continued his assault. Trevor generated a shield around him, and went past the amphibians and out into the water. There were hundreds of them, trying to get on the boat. Trevor went to search for the talisman.</p>
<p>“We can’t hold much longer!” Makaio shouted out to Jake “There are still more smaller groups coming toward us.” Ryan said.</p>
      <p>Trevor went further, until he found a rock with ancient writing carved on it. “The talisman must be under that.” He said to himself. He went over to it, and picked it up. There was a talisman with a picture of a fish on it. “Yes!” Trevor said. He deactivated his shield, and used the talisman to transform into the shark, with the claws and horns. He swam toward the invading army, and started to shoot explosive ice blasts from his mouth. This continued until the creatures retreated. Trevor went back on the ship. He, Brandon, and Jake turned back. “Now we have three.” Brandon said. “Good.” Jake said. “Now, we go to Mount St. Helens for the final talisman, which will be the hardest to get. For the talisman has a master. Growun, the dark dread lord. Be prepared for the ultimate fight. However, do not underestimate the dread lord, he has fought in many battles.” Ino said. “Then, what are we waiting for?” Mr. Gibbons asked.</p>
