      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      Around the dark table, the dark figures surrounded. There were seven, thirteen when you count the guards. They were each wearing red and gold armor. 
<p>“Time is now.” A figure announced.</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” A tall figure asked.</p>
<p>“Yes.” The figure said.</p>
<p>“Good.” The tall figure responded. “The Emperor does not fancy to wait any longer.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, he does not, general.” A different figure said.</p> 
<p>“Very well.” The general pronounced.</p>
<p>“Proceed?” A figure asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, I have been waiting long enough! You have no idea how much I wanted the mission to continue!” The general ranted. He pounded his fist on the table, his red eyes flared. “Do it now or I’ll send you all to the mountain pass, where I will command you to launch another assault that is sure to fail!”</p>
<p>“What about the boys?” A figure asked.</p>
<p>“Take the girls; ask the boys to join us, if they don’t, crush.” The general ordered.</p>
<p>“General, what after?” A lieutenant questioned. They were walking outside the tent, it was night.
“Then, you will be general, and I, Lord Reqror.” The general said, mounting his big spiked reptilelike boar. It had red and gold armor. The general rode toward his tent, around him was an army, thousands of creatures in red and gold armor flickered in the light of fires.
