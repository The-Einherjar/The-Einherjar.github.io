      <h2>Chapter 14</h2>
      “Will you help us?” Jasoner asked. “Your story is quite the story. The rebels alone won’t be able to defeat the sorcerer.” The man on the gold and silver chair said. 
      <p>Thousands of soldiers on horses moved out of the city. Trejakydon got up, Jasoner and Verderk came by. “We got some reinforcements, as you can see.” Verderk said.</p>
      <p>“We just passed into the sorcerer’s territory!” Jasoner exclaimed. An few hours later, they charged into enemy ranks. It was the army that the sorcerer was building to destroy the rebels, and it seemed like they were ready to attack, because they were attacking the rebels. Osirisareses and Jasoner took care of the giants and the bat riders, while the other soldiers took care of the rest of the enemy forces. Willius came up to them after the battle was over, which took only fifteen minutes at the most. “King Cameris, you are late.” He laughed. “I’m glad we got here eventually.” The king chuckled heartily. “What are we waiting for? Let’s attack the sorcerer!” Verderk said.</p>
      <p>The rebel forces and the forces of Luris Coldor were on their way to the sorcerer’s fortress. They were joined by forces from Juris, and Auris, nations north of Luris. They were late, but marched fast. Juris soldiers wore red armor and were armed to the teeth. They had cavalry in chariots and heavy armored horseman.  Warriors of Auris were armored in gold, high-quality armor crafted by Leprechauns, I’m not kidding. The sky got darker and colder as they went on.</p>
