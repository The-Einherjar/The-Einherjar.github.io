      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 23</h2>
      Zror lost some of his cool. “I will not lose to teenagers!” He shouted. Jasoner tried to transform again, Zror outreached his claws to absorb, but Jacklyn used her sword get rid of the claws. Zror roared, Jasoner shot lightning. Zror blocked it with an energy shield, the four teens shot white lightning. Zror was blasted toward the wall. He returned angry. Purple energy appeared on his claws. Suddenly, Osirisareses landed next to him. “Your army is running away.” It said. Zror laughed. “Legendary hero, how nice of all of you to meet me at last. I see you still wield that sword, Talisar.” He said. “It is over.” The fusion uttered. “No, it is not yet.” Zror said. He melted into a shadow and disappeared.
      <p>Even all of Zror’s Elites had run away. “Zror got away.” Ryan said. Inoiker took a deep breath. “So, the war continues.” He said, sadly. Suddenly, a hawk came. “We have to go now!” Inoiker shouted. “What?” Trevor asked. “They are under attack!” Inoiker answered. “Who?” Brandon asked. “Home!” Inoiker said. “We won’t make it in time!” Trevor said in despair. “Yes, we will. I know of a closer portal that sends you to Lynnwood High.” Jasoner said.</p>
      <p>They all appeared near Lynwood High. There were only three thousands attackers, but they looked prepared against the creatures they were fighting, and the Jake, Ryan, Trevor, Brandon, Jasoner, Jaclyn, Cristine, Paulius, Chris, and the creatures were tired. They fought anyway. The Trulor creatures were driving them back. The sun rose, the Cascade Mountains glowed. Suddenly, there was another army, they were clad in gold, and silver. “Gibbons.” Jake said. The Gibbons, and the Kzat army defeated Zror’s attack force in a quick battle. “Thank you, again.” Jake said afterwards. “What do we do know?” Jill asked. “We hunt down Zror.” Ryan said. “We offer you our assistance.” The Kzat general replied. “So, do we.” Mr. Gibbons said. “Gladly accepted.” Jake said. “Does this mean another adventure?” Shealee asked. “Sure does.” Caleb said.</p>
