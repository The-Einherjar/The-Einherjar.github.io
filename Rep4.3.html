    <h1>Reptile Man IV: The Flames of Rorzron</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
      Meanwhile, at school called Lynnwood High, something was about to happen. Troy was outside waiting for class to start, he was a bit early. He got bored and sat on a bench. He was very bored until something that fell from the sky landed on his head. “Ouch.” He said. He saw the small object and picked it up. It was a black gem with some silver on it. “What?” He asked himself. He stared at it for a while. He thought he saw lighting flashing inside of it but he was not sure if it was lighting or just his imagination. His teacher came. “Troy, you’re early aren’t you? Well, at least come inside. It is awful cold out here.” The teacher said. Troy nodded and went inside. 
      <p>During lunch, he sat down and again looked at the strange object which he put in his pocket earlier. “What are you doing?” Someone said. “Hi, Jill.” Troy said still looking at the object. “What’s that?” Jill asked. “I don’t know, it fell on my head earlier. Do you know what it is?” Troy asked. Suddenly, a loud roar filled the air. Giant flapping of wings could be heard outside the building. A great lizard with wings that appeared to be a dragon landed outside. A figure that looked like it was made out of stone leaped off, it was headed toward the door. “Here, hold this please.” Troy said, he handed the gem to Jill. He then went for a closer look. “Is this a prank that the teachers are doing?” Troy said to himself. The thing took a large iron axe and swung it at the windows, breaking them. It then entered the building through broken frame. The students screamed, there was panic. The thing went towards Jill. “Give it to me!” It said in a cold voice. “Give what?” Jill asked. The thing did not answer, it took hold of its axe and kept on moving. Suddenly, a fiery shape slammed into it. “Ryan!” Jill exclaimed. The thing was undamaged and went toward it’s dragon, mounted, and flew into the building again. The dragon roared and shot a fireball. This however, did not harm Ryan. The thing took its axe, the axe grew larger. Ryan pulled out a long metal pole from somewhere in the lunch room. His fiery hand made it hot. The two went into weapon combat, each one swinging their weapons at each other and blocking. This continued until Ryan ran out of luck, his pole was chopped in half. Ryan shot several fireballs. The thing flew up and broke part of the ceiling. Ryan grabbed him with fire arms that burst out of his wings. The dragon attacked Ryan with its claws, Ryan struck with his wings, the thing fell to the ground and went towards Jill. Troy got the cooler half of Ryan’s pole and slammed it on the thing. The thing lifted its axe, ready to throw it. Ryan saw this and shot a large fire stream and slammed his tail on the dragon to make it back away. The thing saw that the battle could last hours, so it got on its dragon and took off saying, “I’ll return.” </p>
