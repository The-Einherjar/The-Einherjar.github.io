    <h1>Reptile Man V: The Destiny of The Talismans</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
   The Moltezron and the dragons approached. The plague grew taller, lightning surrounded it. Two vast wings and a long spiky tail  appeared. Arms formed and stretched out with sharp claws. Two red eyes came into view. A gigantic spiky mace appeared in its hands. Fog surrounded the shadow figure, it was taller than the hill. Zarakqua lifted up its mace and hit Aroseer. The Moltezron shot a fireball, Zarakqua swung the mace and reflected the fireball back at the Moltezron, who was not hurt because of its resistance to fire. Osirsareses shot a fire stream, it hit Zarakqua’s wings. Zarakqua’s mace shot lightning at Osirisareses, the lighting hit the wings and the great dragon fell to the ground. Zarakqua was about to strike Osirisareses its his mace, but Aroseer countered this with a giant fireball that separated into ten smaller fireballs and hit the plague. Blades appeared in both hands of the Moltezron, he hit Zarakqua several times. Osirisareses got back up and flew towards Zarakqua’s head and shot ice at it. The mace was swung and broke the ice. Aroseer shot a fire stream at Zarakqua’s face while the Moltezrons was striking Zarakqua with a lava blade. Osirisareses took wrapped his vines around Zarakqua’s arm with the mace, the bludgeon fell to the ground.
  <p>The battle was blazing, Cyport was split but his four parts flew in the air and attacked the creatures. The Skull Baron struck with a blade, and shot his firearm. Troy, Brian, and Alex dispatched a plague creature. The glowing Sword of Zat slashed two creatures with a reverberating chime. The Gibbons fought charging monsters. Then, two shapes came down from the air, Jordan and the plague/reptile.  Jordan shot a bronze beam; the reptile leaped and clawed a plague monster. “I guess he is on our side.” Makaio said. “I gave him some grub.” Brianna replied. Then, Alex’s army, and the Inster division arrived. “Yes, finally!” Alex verbalized, gladly. The army attacked the plague creatures. Jill attempted to transform, she couldn’t change into the dragon, but two white and gold wings appeared on her back. She vaulted with her wings and slashed a monster with her sword. She then bombarded charging creatures with gold fire.</p>
  <p>Zarakqua broke the vines and grabbed the mace, it swung it at Osirisareses who was knocked all the way to the ground from the force. Zarakqua lifted up the mace again. Osirisareses charged an attack, suddenly, something that was camouflaged appeared on Zarakqua’s face, the plague/reptile He shot a  blast that caused Zarakqua to lose concentration. The reptile leaped on Osirisareses’s back. “Good boy.” The dragon said, he shot the radiant beam. Zarakqua plunged to the mountain. The Moltezron and Aroseer flew further away and both shot fire streams. Zarakqua tried to get up. Gost leaped on top of Osirisares’s back. “How did you?” Osirisareses started. “I’m a frog creature, I can jump that high. Let’s get him with a talisman strike!” Gost said. They attacked Zarakqua at the same time in a tri-attack. Gost shot his secret power, a bolt of lightning twirling a red torrent of photon energy. The reptile discharged a corona plasma blast, Osirisareses shot his radiant beam. The three attacks swirled around each other and formed a great stream that crashed into Zarakqua. The Moltezron and Aroseer shot fire. The towering monster plummeted to the Earth,  it dissipated into fog. “What now?” Gost uttered. The cloud continued to engulf the landscape. “We haven’t defeated it.” Osirisareses said.</p>
