      Jake camouflaged in the grass, the ninja searched around, confused. Brandon tried to wrap his thorns around his opponent, but the thorns were sliced off by a sword. Trevor tried to attack with his horn, however, the ninja skillfully blocked with his two swords, some short of a sword fight started. Ryan grabbed his opponent and threw him in the air. Garry started to block ninja attacks with his sword, the battle had begun. The ninja Ryan threw, landed on his feet and attacked Brandon. Jake appeared behind his foe, and hit him with his tail, the ninja turned around and threw a ninja star. The weapon embedded in Jake’s claw. The ninja, then charged forward, before he could stab, was stopped by Garry. Brandon was taking some hits, Ryan and Trevor tried to aid him, but the ninjas kept on avoiding them. Garry tried again and again to strike at the fast ninja. Jake thumped the ninja with his claws. Garry hit the ninja’s two swords with an energy blade and broke them. The ninja ran off, Garry then took out his laser bow and knocked a laser arrow and shot it at an incoming ninja. That ninja also ran off. The other three ninjas were attacking Brandon. “That is quite enough!” Brandon exclaimed, he shot a solar blast  the ninjas. Ryan grabbed another with a fiery arm from his wing, and threw it to the ground. Trevor shot ice and froze a ninja’s arms, both ninjas bolted. The one Brandon attacked was still on the ground. “Why did you attack us?” Garry asked. “I was hired to.” The ninja said breathing heavily. “Who hired?” Ryan inquired. “I will never tell you!” The ninja bellowed, he got off the ground and flung a black sphere to the ground. Smoke  dispersed, the ninja disappeared.
