    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    They finally arrived at the site, the sky was getting dark. “Where is it?” Trevor asked. “I don’t know, but there is something wrong here.” Ryan said. A roar suddenly sounded behind them, they turned around. The shape was enormous, about thirty feet high. It had a fifty-foot orange,  moth-like wingspan. It was covered with fur that was volcanic rock, steam came out. Its head was like an otter’s, the wings were like liquid volcanic glass. It had a dragon tail. “What is it?” Trevor asked. “It is a Moltezron.” Ino said, he nearly fell to the ground. The beast stampeded for an assault. “Another fire creature, eh? Alright then.” Ryan said. Trevor tried to attack, The Moltezron altered its arm into magma, it transmuted into a blade and solidified. It slashed at Trevor, who fell to the ground with a burn on his fin.  Jake camouflaged. The heat waves increased, the camouflage stopped working. Jake was sent spiraling into the air after being hit by the blade. “I know a plant creature attacking a fire creature is nutty, but...” Brandon said, he charged. A stream of fire came out of the Moltezron’s mouth. Brandon barley withstood it, he had generated an energy shield, he fell to the ground.  “Okay, it’s between you and me now.” Ryan said. He shot a fireball, testing the Moletzron’s defenses. The Moltezron took to the air and landed on Ryan, and then slashed him with the rock blade. Meanwhile, someone was  watching. “Hmm.... Better help them.” He said, he leaped high into the air and landed in front of the Moltezron. This guy had a tail, two wings, and his arms were dragon heads with claws. “Jordan?” Jake asked. “Yes.” He said. Jordan held up one of his arms and shot a silver stream. The blast sent the Moltezron to the ground, it roared. The Moltezrons was busy while the four got up. “He can’t fight that thing forever.” Ryan said. “What is the plan?” Brandon asked. “Let’s get the fusion out there, shall we?” Jake said. “I was waiting for someone to suggest that.” Trevor said. They each glowed, the Moltezron turned from a hammered Jordan, and faced the pillar of  light. When the light disappeared, Osirisareses stood, he roared. . The Moltezron lashed out it’s blade, Osirisareses quickly evaded. The Moltezron attempted to fire a stream of lava, but missed. The Moltezron took off in the air and went after Osirisareses. Fireball after fireball was shot at the dragon, but they were avoided. Osirisareses turned around to face the fiery enemy. The Moltezron  transformed its other arm into a blade, it tried to strike the dragon, but missed and was hit by an  icicle. Osirisareses lashed out his thorns, but they started to burn. The attack was canceled and replaced by another icicle, but that was melted by a fireball. It suddenly started to rain, thunder roared as the two great beasts clawed each other. Osirisareses shot an ice blast, freezing the Moltezron. The ice melted, but the water hardened and the dragon otter slow. Osirisareses took this chance to carry the it to Puget Sound, he released the Moltezron in the water. The Moltezrons was stopped, for now. As soon as the dragon returned back, turned back into his four human forms. “The time draws near.” Ino said. “What?” Troy asked. “Moltezrons didn’t rouse for no reason. Great evil is approaching. It must have thought you were it. We can expect a lot of uninvited guests very soon.” Ino added.
