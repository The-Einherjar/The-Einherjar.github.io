      <p>Jake was walking back and forth in his neighborhood. He was thinking and waiting. They were going to have a meeting there. His neighbor, Min Su came toward him. “Hey Jake, what are you doing?” He asked. He had a blue and gray staff, with blades on each side. “Just waiting.” Jake replied. “For what?” Min Su asked.
