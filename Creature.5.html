      <h1>The Creature of Ancient Destruction</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
 The mist was still there. Something was coming, that is what everyone thought. They were right. A seven foot figure came out of the mist, it was in armor and had two iron maces with spikes, and a sword that looked dull but was actually sharp. His claws looked like they were made out of metal, he had a head with six horns on it, and five red eyes. Behind him, were several creatures that looked like the minions Grutwaq used to attack the Gibbon’s house. “It is Tratwaq.” Min Su said. “Tratwaq?” Brandon asked. “He is one of the main generals of Grutwaq.” Zrisitis said. “The dragon must have unleashed the Nightmare World.” Min Su said. Growlor and his minions went toward Tratwaq. “We welcome you to our city.” Growlor said. “Captain Ryan.” Drr said running towards them. “Drr?” Ryan asked. “We must prevent them from joining in an alliance.” Drr said.  “Drr!” Growlor called. ”You know Growlor?” Brandon asked. “Yes.” Drr answered. “When the Fire attacked our people we fought in the conflict. He saved my life during a battle. After our defeat, our people hurried to the surface. Growlor did not.” He said. Growlor spoke. “You stole my life. She was my girl.” He uttered. “She chose.” Drr said. “You failed to protect her. I would have not have.” Growlor declared. “You established a band of criminals for the reason of her not choosing you?” Drr asked. “She belonged to me! Since I did not get her, I’ll take your world.” Growlor said unseaththing the dagger. Drr drew his scimitar. “You have been to this place haven’t you? The Realm of Nightmares.” Growlor asked, looking at Garry. Garry drew his sword and waited. He remembered when Cyport sent them to the Nightmare World, and when Inoik escaped. ”This is our town. Join us or  we will destroy you.” Growlor demanded. “Under no circumstances.” Ryan said. Tratwaq drew his two maces, the minions also drew out their weapons. Min Su and Zrisitis drew their weapons and waited. The waiting seemed like it lasted for hours. Ryan began to wonder what would take longer, the waiting or the actual battle. One of Tratwaq’s rubber minions attacked, the minion fell to the ground. Garry had slashed. Growlor tried to slice Garry with his dagger, but was stopped by Drr, who blocked the dagger with his scimitar. Ryan and Tratwaq clashed.
