The mist was still there. Something was coming, that is what everyone thought. They were right. “Captain Ryan.” Drr said running towards them. “Drr!” Growlor called. ”You know Growlor?” Brandon asked. “Yes.” Drr answered. “When the Fire attacked our people we fought in the conflict. He saved my life during a battle. After our defeat, our people hurried to the surface. Growlor did not.” He said. Growlor spoke. “You stole my life. She was my girl.” He uttered. “She chose.” Drr said. “You failed to protect her. I would have not have.” Growlor declared. “You established a band of criminals for the reason of her not choosing you?” Drr asked. “She belonged to me! Since I did not get her, I’ll take your world.” Growlor said unseaththing the dagger. Drr drew his scimitar. “You have been to this place haven’t you? The Realm of Nightmares.” Growlor asked, looking at Garry. Garry drew his sword and waited. He remembered when Cyport sent them to the Nightmare World, and when Inoik escaped. ”This is our town. Join us or  we will destroy you.” Growlor demanded. “Under no circumstances.” Ryan said. Suddenly, the ground shook. “Something is approaching, from the Nightmare World world. What have you wrought?” Zrisitis asked, Growlor couldn’t answer.
“Everyone, change into your most powerful battle forms!” Ryan called. “With pleasure.” Jake said. Min Su metamorphosed into the diamond behemoth Jake turned into Reptile Man, Brandon turned into The Lord Of The Oaks, Trevor turned into Fish Master, Ryan turned into Fire Reptile Man, Min Su turned into his diamond golem form. The four Ryan, Jake, Trevor, and Brandon then fused together, and upgraded into the more powerful fusion form. Drr transformed into a silver bear  There, in the fog stood two hundred feet high, a terrible creature. It was dark purple, translucent rubber, and had a fifty foot long spiky tail. It’s eyes were red, it had large, ultra strong arms with razor claws, it’s legs were like two gigantic tree roots with claws., it had a vast eight hundred foot wingspan, in it’s mouth were razor fangs, and it had four horns on it’s head that looked like a evil crown. It looked down at it’s eight enemies. “I told you I would come back!” It roared. It was Grutwaq, the creature of ancient destruction.
