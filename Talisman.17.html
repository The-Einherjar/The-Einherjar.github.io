      They were in the park where they met Jasoner. Immediately, they felt the air of a showdown impending. It was cloudy, there was wind moving through. “Trevor? Brandon? Ryan? Jake?” A voice, suddenly asked. It was Alan Gibbons, who was in the park with his family,  Garry was there. “Mr. Gibbons?” Trevor asked. “Everybody has been worried about you. You have been gone for quite a while.” Alan answered. “We were in another dimension.” Jake let drop. “Oh? That’s cool.” Mal said, taken aback a little. They weren’t quite expecting that explanation; however, it wasn’t a colossal surprise. “I’m glad to see you, what is going on here?” Jake asked. In the bushes, there was a voice that they didn’t hear. “Destroy them.” It ordered. “This strange group has come to this city, and are terrorizing the populace. We are laboring to stop them; however, they withdraw when we enter the scene. I don’t trust them. I think that they are up to something.” Garry explained.  Jill drew near. “I think they are waiting for you.” She said. Suddenly, Jake got a cold shiver down his spine and ducked. An arrow hit a tree behind him. Four ninjas were racing towards them. “Shoot! Already?” Ryan exclaimed. A fifth ninja came and drew two swords from two sheaths on his back, he rest did the same. Garry drew his sword. The four turned into Reptile Man, Lord of The Oaks, Fish Master, and Fire Reptile Man. “You got the Talismans back?” Garry asked. “Oh yeah.” Jake said. “Bring it on.” Brandon said. The ninjas leaped at them. “Welcome back guys.” Alan said.
