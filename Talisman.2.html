      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      Ryan, Jake, Brandon, and Trevor were in a park when suddenly, a strange person came. The person was in a dark blue suit with a black cape. He turned to the four teens and walked towards them. “Heroes of legend!” He cried. “What?” Trevor asked. “I have been searching for you.” The stranger said. “Why?” Brandon asked. “I am from the realm you are meant to save.” The stranger said. “Realm?” Ryan asked. “I am Zrenoroy. The sorcerer is waging war on us.” The stranger replied. "I am not sure you have the right people.” Jake said. “We don’t know of any sorcerer attacking another realm.” Ryan finished. “Very well, I must continue my search then.” Zrenoroy said sadly, as he walked away. “What do you think that was about?” Trevor asked. “I don’t know.” Ryan said, looking at Zrenoroy walk away.
      <p>They were observing the stranger, they fell asleep on the ground. They had a dream. “Where are we?” Ryan asked. Lights lit up. “You are at Bamtou.” A figure said, it was an Inster. “Inokrezidir?” Jake asked. “Yes.” Inokrezidir said. “Why do you bring us here?” Brandon asked. “I understand a mysterious person came to ask you for help.” Inokrezidir said. “We were not sure what he was. He may have been attempting to trap us, we have a lot of enemies. Should I have said otherwise?” Ryan asked. “I am not familiar to what he said.” Inokrezidir answered. “We were watching him to see if it was a game or if he needed our help.” Trevor said. “I am not sure, but I feel like you should help him.” Inokrezidir replied. “Stand by.”  He said. He placed a stone with a diamond it on a stone wall, he turned it. A window on the wall opened and Inokrezidir took out four round objects. “Recognize these four things?” He asked. “The Talismans.” Jake said. Inokrezidir tossed each one to each of the four teens. “I am giving them back to you.” Inokrezidir explained. “Has the plague been neutralized?” Brandon asked. Inokrezidir stuttered. “Yes.” He answered, he then led them to a sword that was stuck on the floor. The sword was at least six feet long, its blade was rainbow color with the talisman symbols inscribed. Ancient writing was also on the blade. The handle was gold with silver lines and four diamonds, each of them had its own color, orange, green, brown, and blue. “This is an ancient sword that no one ever wielded, not even the Insters that forged it. It has been kept in this floor for very long time. The floor allows only the ones with the Talismans to draw it out. I believe you four must now draw it out.” Inokrezidir spoke. The four teens each took hold of the handle and pulled it, a flash of green, blue, and orange lit up the room as the sword came up. Talisar, the Sword of The Talismans was for the first time, lifted up. The sword and the four teens glowed, when the light disappeared there was only one figure. He was tall, and looked like all four of the teens, he had strong muscles unlike what all four of them originally had. His hair was spiked up and was orange and brown. “You four have fused together into one. Now all four of you can wield any talisman and can even change directly into Osirisareses. Now, go with that person to this realm he speaks of and stop this sorcerer. Remember that if the realm is taken and affected by the sorcerer’s evil magic, this world may also be affected in an evil way. Who knows what will happen if you fail.” Inokrezidir finished. The four were teleported. “Should we have told them, Ino?” Inokrezidir asked. Ino came from the shadows. “Not today, let them confront one conflict  at a time with this. The Talismans are safe now.” He said.</p>
      <p>They were back in the park, it was night .They were now searching for the person they saw earlier. They also made a name for their fused self, Trejakrydon. They had the sword, Talisar in a sheath on their back. Suddenly, they saw Zrenoroy. Trejakrydon went up to him. “We go with you.” They said.</p>
