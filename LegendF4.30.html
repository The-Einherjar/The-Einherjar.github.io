      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 30</h2>
     Zror summoned all his generals. Flarog, Embras, Treysor, the two generals of the Stouses, the general of the Giztons, the general of the Marrzrons, who was seven feet tall, with two tentacles as arms, its mouth had jaws, and the head was covered by a metal helmet, and Reqror were there. They were around a boulder. “My emperor, spies report that the alliance is headed toward the western mountains.” Flarog said. “Our chance has come.” Zror mused. “Prepare to attack.” 
    <p>The Gorzos had decided to join. Their army had swiftly ran to the northwest. A hawk arrived with a letter. It was from Gost, it said that that the alliance was going to the Olympic Mountains, and to meet them there as soon as possible. Jonathan, Jake’s cousin, just then came with a dragon. “Hey, buddy!” Jonathan said. “What is that?” Jake asked. “A Silver Dragon, the fastest dragon.” Jonathan replied.</p>
    <p>They went towards the Olympic Mountains. They flew over Mount Rainier, when they  reached the beach, the sun was setting. When they made it to where the army was, they landed. The alliance was entrenched in and around the Firemancer tower. Gost came over. “A Silver Dragon! How did-“ He started, before he could finish, General Reqror came on a lizard boar, waving a flag of a herald.</p>
    <p>“The great Emperor, Zror, demands the legendary heroes, and Cristine, and Jaclyn.” Reqror announced. “I got a demand myself; give back my little ones!” Mr. Gibbons declared. “You refuse?” Reqror asked. “We refuse.” Gost answered. “So be it.” Reqror said. He got on the lizard boar and rode off.</p>
    <p>“They’re coming!” Paul, said he was in his dragon form. “How many?” Mr. Schwab asked. Spy reports though, state Zror’s force is in the area of twenty million.” Gost stated. “Twenty million!? That’s higher than Zron!” Gost exclaimed  “We got 564,000 from the Four Schools and Kzat, 80,000 from the northern schools, 160,000 of the southern, 31,000 Stouse allies, with more en route. 88,000 Marineers, 232 Gorzos are on the road.” Jake said. “Seriously?” Ryan asked, worried. “Not many Gorzos remain, these 232 Gorzo warriors are like a great army.” Jake said, sadly. “So, roughly speaking, we have 923,232.” Gost declared. “Actually,” Trevor started; a huge grin was on his face. “When Brandon and I went to Trulaz, we discovered something. Every five hundred years, a huge entrance between our world and Trulaz opens here. The forces of Luris Coldor, and the Mountain Republic, and our expeditionary force are waiting.” He said.</p>
