      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
   “Move along!” The soldier roared. Hundreds of men, woman, and children were herded across the plain. Creatures in red and gold armor guarded. General Reqror was on a hill looking, Zror was nearby. He grinned an evil grin. These people were citizens of a small nation, the capital was in shambles. The people were captured. “Emperor!” A solder exclaimed, arriving with a prisoner. This prisoner was wearing white armor, he was a soldier from the mountain republic. “I was wanting to capture one.” Zror sneered. The soldier looked boldly into Zror’s eyes. “Our four founders will defeat you!” He declared. Zror smiled, wickedly, and laughed without opening his mouth. “Let’s ask these people and see if they have your fire.” He said. “Captain Willius, what do you have to say?” Zror asked, pointing to a man in chains. Captain Willius did the same the other man and stared into Zror’s eyes. “Long live liberty! The legendary hero will be sent to overthrow you!“ He uttered. Zror did not find this amusing. A young woman sung, it was a lullaby she singed to her sister.
      <p>Go to sleep my little child
      Though the winds may not be mild
      The Hero will arise and sever the helm
      Of evil in this realm
</p>
      <p>The others began to sing it. When they finished a great wolf with two scorpion stings attacked the emperor’s army. Many people were freed. The wolf disappeared before Zror could attack, to defend the people he did free, many of them were women and children. “Let them be.” The emperor ordered. “My emperor?” A soldier asked. “ Fear will come, because of their stories.” The emperor said.</p>
      <p>It was night, the people were still singing. “So, you want to try again?” A general asked. “Yes, this time I go.”Reqror said. “Doesn’t the emperor need to agree?” The other general questioned.. “No. After I succeed, he will be pleased.” Reqror explained. Outside, the singing stopped after one last round.</p>
<p>Go to sleep my little child
      Though the winds may not be mild
      The Hero will arise and sever the helm
      Of evil in this realm
