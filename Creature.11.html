      <h1>The Creature of Ancient Destruction</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
     Min Su and Zrisitis were cold, very cold. Min Su transformed into his creature form. Finally, they got into the underground chamber they were searching for in Mount Baker. They saw a blue diamond in the middle of the chamber, they went over and picked it up. At that moment, a giant crack appeared on the ground and a huge monster came out of it. It was at least fifty feet tall and was covered with ice as armor.  It  had two long arms giant. It also had a shark head full of icicle teeth. The monster tried to hit Min Su with an arm, but Min Su’s armor protected him. Zrisitis flew around the creature. Min Su burrowed under the ground, the shark attacked Zrisitis. Min Su, suddenly burst from the ground and slammed into the monster. Zrisitis sent a razor wind, the ice shark lost its balance, and fell  into the crevasse it came out of. Zrisitis and Min Su ran out of the chamber with the diamond as quickly as possible.
      <p>They were all back at the Gibbons houses with the pieces on a table. “Now what?”  Zrisitis asked. “We put them together.” Gost answered. “Shouldn't we take it to a blacksmith or something?” Brianna asked. “I can see how it fits.” Jake said. “Yes it fits like this.” Caleb said, he put the two sword blades together and placed the handle and and the diamond under the blade. The sword  glowed, when it stopped the sword was pieced together. “That was cool.” Jill stated. “We should do it again.” Shaley added.</p>
