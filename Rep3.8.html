    <h1>Reptile Man III: Dawn of the Talismans</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
      The dark shapes moved closer. There were at least four catapults and there were carts full of large stones. One of the creatures went on top of a catapult and blew a war horn which echoed through the air. Another catapult fired. The stone hit the wall, but failed to knock it down. Tim took out a horn for their defense force and blew it. Jill, Caleb, Garry, and Andrew took their bows, and each of them knocked an arrow. Two more catapults fired but the wall still stood strong. “Wow, we made quite the wall.” Jake said. The massive army kept on moving toward the wall. Jill, Caleb, Garry and Andrew fired their first arrows. Two of them hit two Grutwaq minions working on a catapult. They fell of the platform of the catapult and landed on the ground. The other two went to the fourth line of the attackers, however, they were unable to tell if they hit anything or not. One of the large minions put a boulder on a catapult. Garry shot an arrow at it, the thing roared. It then got angry and shot the catapult, which bounced off the wall like the other boulders did. The Gibbons shot more arrows at it. Garry knocked two arrows and shot both of them and downed the giant minion. “This is easy so far.” Brandon said. Suddenly, the twenty mini bots came flying towards them and attacked. “It is now time!” Ryan declared, he, Jake, Trevor and Brandon changed into their talisman forms. Soon everyone on the wall was in a fight with the mini bots. Quickly, all of the machines were eliminated, but they soon learned the robots were a distraction, because now the enemies were on their doorsteps. “They are using ladders!” Troy said. About two black ladders slammed against the wall. Grutwaq’s minions climbed. When the first minion got to the top, Tim slashed. The minion fell to the ground. Tim’s two brothers did the same to other minions who got to the top. Trevor was busy holding off the other ladders by freezing them before they were placed, this made the ladders too heavy for the minions to carry, and even when they could carry them it was too cold to climb anyway. Ryan shot fireballs at the approaching army. “I’m being careful, I do not want to overcook since there are houses around us.” He said. He said. Jake clawed the minions that came near him. Garry was busy trying to prevent ladders from being placed, he already dispatched four giant minions. The giant underlings now wanted to get him. Six of them charged at the wall with their great battle axes. Garry shot an arrow at the first one. The arrow hit, but it did not stop. When Jake saw the giant minion of Grutwaq come with its great axe, he tried to get to it but was too far away and was having some problems of his own. “Take that thing down, Ino!” He directed. Ino, who had a large bag on him containing large spears, he took one and hurled it. The spear was about four feet long, and its sharp end had a red diamond. The spear struck the minion on the shoulder, but he still did not stop. Andrew drew out two arrows from his quiver and shot the giant creature. The minion still ran toward the wall in a desperate attempt to break it. Garry kept on shooting arrows as quick as he could. At the last moment, when the minion was about to swing his eight-foot-long axe, something happened. The axe dropped, the minion fell to the ground motionless. “That was close.” Garry said. The other giant minions were headed toward the wall, suddenly they stopped, at that moment the huge army of Grutwaq halted their arrow shooting and their ladder climbing. Just then, a  sound was heard, it sounded like a gigantic eagle. Ryan was looking around for where the sound was coming from, so did Trevor. Soon they got their answer, which was two giant shadows. When they looked up, there were two giant shapes in the air. They were at a length of forty feet long, they each had a wingspan of one hundred feet. They each had a long spiky tail with a large blade at the end, they also had two long necks with thorns covering the back, and their heads were serpent like with long horns on them. The two creatures seemed to be covered in a giant set of armor, and their very tongues had smoke coming out of them with sparks flying in the air making a hissing sound. “The two greatest servants of Grutwaq, the reckless twin headed dragons of the reptile realm of Gorzo. These two were so destructive that the Gorzo banished them, and unfortunately they joined Grutwaq.” Ino said. One of the dragons slammed its tail against the wall, creating a large crack. The wall fortunately, did not fall. Well, not this time anyway... Jake, Ryan, Trevor, and Brandon gathered around. “Do you think we are strong enough to take them on?” Ryan asked. “Well, if we concentrate on one of them the other will get us when we are off guard.” Trevor said. “We could split up into two and each take one on.” Jake said. “Okay then, what are we waiting for?” Brandon said, leaping on top of one of the dragons. Ryan followed him, Jake and Trevor went to battle the second. Ryan used his fiery claws and started to claw the first dragon’s back. One of its heads turned toward him, and shot a stream of fire. Ryan did not have to worry about this, but Brandon had to dodge, he then charged up a solar blast and shot it at the head that shot the fire. This was followed by Ryan’s fire arms that come out of his wings, he then shot his own stream of fire when the head was not looking. The head thought that the other head did it, and started to fight. Ryan and Brandon jumped off. Soon, the dragon fell to the ground. At the same time, Jake shot his  attacks at both the second dragon’s heads. Both heads shot fire, causing Jake to crash into the wall. This was somewhat of a distraction, because Trevor took this opportunity to freeze both heads, causing them to crash to the ground. Without warning, the crack on the wall got bigger and that part of the wall broke off. The army of Grutwaq now charged in. Tim, Frank, and Pete jumped off the wall and started to fight the invading minions. The others did the same. More and more minions came, pouring in like rain. “We can’t hold them for much longer!” Ino shouted. “We must try!” Makaio shouted back.
      <p>The army followed the smoke, about twenty thousand of them. They spotted a distress smoke earlier and followed it. Soon, they came upon a neighborhood with thousands of rubber things besieging a house with a broken wall in front of it. “Are we too late?” One of the soldiers asked. “No, but we are late for protecting the wall. Blow the horn!” The leader ordered. A loud horn was blown. Everyone, stopped including Grutwaq’s army. They stared at the unknown army. “Charge!” the leader shouted. They army ran toward the army of Grutwaq. “Turn around!” A minion, who seemed to be the leader ordered. Another horn was blown. Grutwaq’s army charged. The two armies collided like two cars. In secret, a giant minion riding a large beast rode away and slashed a soldier from the unknown army in the process. Within a half an hour or more, the enemy army was finally defeated. Makaio found the leader of the unknown army, Alex “This army is from ancient Kzat, they asked me to lead.” He said. “Well, we must thank you. We don’t know how to repay you.” Troy said. “Where’s the Gibbons?” Makaio asked. “I thought Jill and Caleb were with you?” Jake said. “I can’t find them.” Makaio said. “Garry, you were with them weren’t you?” Michael asked. No answer. “Garry?” Jake asked. Garry was not with them. “Are they in the house?” Ino asked. “No, the house is empty, not even their cat is in there.” Ryan replied. A soldier from Alex’s army, who was barley moving came toward them. He was the one that was slashed by the rider that slipped away. “He took them.” He said. “What?” Brandon asked. “One of the large enemies that rode on a large beast, took them and rode north.” The soldier said again. “All of them?” Jake asked. The soldier nodded his head. “We failed to defend them.” Frank said. “Not if we could help it.” Ryan said. “We will go to Mount Baker, and get them back.” Jake said.</p>
      <p>They started towards Mount Baker with all the speed they had. Little did they know, the two dragons of Grutwaq woke up and took off.</p>
