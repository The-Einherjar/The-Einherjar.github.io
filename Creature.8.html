  <h1>The Creature of Ancient Destruction</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
  Osirisareses landed on the ground and changed back into his four original forms. They had dropped their passengers off at other places and were now at Bamtou, they were teleported. “I see you are trying to get one of the pieces of  the sword. you need Talisar. That is the sword of elements. I will show you the entrance of the underground labyrinth, but first, you need Talisar, it is “the blade of four ancient forged elements”.” Inokrezidir explained, he led them to Talisar, which was in the stone tile floor just as they have left it. The four drew it out, they fused into Trejakydon. Inokrezidir took a giant seven foot long key from the wall and stuck it into the hole that Talisar was in and turned it. The floor twisted down and formed stairs. “Careful, there are dangerous creatures that hunt for dinner down there. There though, is the piece you seek.” Inokrezidir warned. Trejakydon moved down the stairs into the darkness...
  <p>It was raining, lightning flashed across the sky. Grutwaq looked at his new fortress being built. “It is almost finished.” He said to himself. “When it is, I will get rid of my enemies.” He cackled.</p>
  <p>It was dark, Osirisareses needed to use Talisar to light up the way. He didn’t see any creatures, could tell that he wasn’t alone. Suddenly out of the darkness, flew a thing. The dragon slashed at it with Talisar. The thing fell to the ground, it was a big spider. Finally, he entered a room, in the room was a golden blade shard, this had to be the piece he was looking for. However, when he moved towards it, something dropped to the floor in front of him. It was a great spider with the head of a cobra. The spider sent a web string up to the ceiling and went up with it.  It’s cobra head stretched out to bite, but missed. Osirisareses shot a fire stream at the web, the net caught fire. The spider dropped to the ground roared. It then leaped on top of him and wrapped him in a web. Osirisareses shot ice from his arms, the web froze and broke. The spider shot poisonous liquid,  which burned Osirisareses’s on diamond armor. The dragon vaulted and enlarge his thorn claws, he threw the spider across a passageway, he picked up the golden blade shard and withdrew.</p>
