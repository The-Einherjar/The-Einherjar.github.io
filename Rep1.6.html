      <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
      <p>Jake woke up, a dream. They had not the least bit started the journey.</p>
      <p>The doorbell rang the door was answered by Jake, Alex, Brian and Troy walked in. "Who does he think he is?" Troy asked himself. "What did he mean by he was in charge? Is he a toad? What was he talking about the sword of changing?" He kept on asking. "Sword of changing?" Jake asked. "I fear there is only one way to solve this." Troy said. "What would that be?" Alex asked. "I’m going over to Jill’s house. There I ought to find answers. Troy declared. ”What happened?" Jake asked. "Well we were racing back so we won’t be late for the party." Alex started. "Then we ran into someone." Brian continued. "It was a frog who challenged us to a sword duel. He smashed Brian, I was defeated as well." Alex said. ”I am going to pay Jill a little visit. It appears that Magire Toad has decided to stay the night over there." Troy said.</p>
      <p>They were finally there Troy rang the doorbell. Jill’s father opened it they went in the house cautiously. “There is no.. bad luck.  Mr. Gibbons said to Jake. “Huh?” Jake said. “The sword…” Jill’s father was resisting the toad’s grasp. “It.. manipulates your mind… However, it does not cause… luck. Remember, we choose our destiny.” Gibbons said.</p>
      <p>"Okay Alex, you distract, Brian you search around and report back. I’ll go downstairs and find Magire Toad. Jake with me “Troy said. Jake went downstairs. He saw Jill in a strange bed with a curtain around it. He went further but before he went any further he saw a toad on a chair sleeping. Well it looked like he was sleeping anyway. In his lap was a strange sword. The Sword of Changing. Troy went further and further. At last he was right next to the curtained bed. He pulled the curtains. "Hi Jill." He said. Jill got up surprised. "Who are you?" She asked. "I am Troy. Don’t you remember? What is going on in this house? There are big toads everywhere, your family seems to be under their spell, there is a toad right next to this bed." Troy said. "I have no idea whatsoever. He just came with a bunch of toads and took over." Jill said. "We better get out of here. When we escape we can gather your neighbors, and my neighbors and friends and build an army to stand up against this menace." Jake suggested. "That is a very courageous thing you are proposing but we can’t win. He has powers that come from his sword. In fact, you better leave before he catches you." Jill said. "I am aware of what his sword can do. I am not leaving without you." Jake said. The toad suddenly woke up. "Get out of here now." Jill ordered. The toad looked at Jill. "I have something that I would like to ask you." The toad said. "What?" Jill asked. The toad reached into one of his pockets and took a silver ring with a blue diamond. "I need a queen and I have chosen one. Will you marry me?" The toad asked. There was ten seconds of silence until screams were heard. "Magire Toad! Interferers!" Brian and Alex came running down yelling. "Troy! We’re sorry! We tried the best we could! It was our bad luck" They both shouted. "You two!" The toad roared. "Uh oh..." Brian said. "I thought I taught you a lesson! Well I guess coming here might have been bad luck, because now I am going to cause you even more bad luck." The toad said. He lifted his sword up high into the air. "No!!" Troy shouted. He charged at the toad with his spear. "I wouldn’t do that if I were you." The toad said calmly. He blocked the spear with his sword, Alex and Brian drew their swords, they were the same swords they bought before they were defeated by the toad. Jake turned into the reptile "You dare challenge me again?" The toad said laughing.  Brian and Alex attacked with their swords, but they were blocked. "You don’t have armor this time." Brian laughed. "Yes, but watch this!" The toad said, the sword of changing glowed and all the toad’s armor and diamonds appeared on him and his shield appeared in the air and was grabbed by the toad. "What?" Alex said looking like he was confused and frustrated at the same time. "My sword is the sword of changing isn’t it? Well you could say that I changed my clothes." The toad said. They continued to fight, each of their blows were blocked. "You are disappointing." The toad mocked. He leaped up into the air and dived down at Alex and Brian. Alex’s sword was knocked to the ground. The toad then did the same to Brian’s sword. Troy tried to attack but the toad countered by. Troy fell to the ground. The sword flashed Jake forced back into human form "I have won again." The toad said laughing. He was about to use his sword of changing, but Jill went up to him and hugged him to distract him. Alex, Brian, and Troy then ran upstairs and ran out the door. They didn’t look back and didn’t stop until they got home. That was close, too close... </p>
