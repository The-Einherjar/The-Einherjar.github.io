      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
  Jaclyn passed Jake, she stared at him, Jake answered “no”. Jake sat down, still no hearing from Jasoner. That is why he answered “no”. Jaclyn had a worried look. Like Paulius, she had the principal’s permission to carry a white sword. She had been ready to fight since a week after the events, six months ago, so was Cristine. They were trained to use the swords. The four schools prepared, they now had 120,000 creatures guarding Mountlake Terrace High. This was not the only thing, they sent spies to the portal in the Cascades, and patrolled the forest. They received word that the spies sighted Zror’s agents near the forest gateway. The scouts failed to catch them. By dawn, the four schools and allies received the report. “Not a word?” Jaclyn asked.
“No.” Jake said.
“Hmm...”  Jaclyn sighed.
“I know what you’re thinking.” Jake commented.
“I want to go. What if he has been captured? “ Jaclyn asked.
“What if you are captured?” Someone new asked, it was a soldier in gold and red armor. Jake transformed into a reptile and battled the warrior. There were screams, Cristine and Paulius were dueling Trulor soldiers with their swords, Cristine had a white sword like Paulius’s. A soldier came at Jaclyn, who defended with her sword. Jake struggled, this guy was harder than the other gold and red armored warriors he fought with. Jaclyn and Cristine, were disarmed and were carried, off but that didn’t cause them to quit hitting. Jake and Paulius chased after them. They arrived outside; in their path was General Reqror. He glared.
