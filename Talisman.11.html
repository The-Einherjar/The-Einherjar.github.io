      <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
      They traveled in the northern mountains for three days. In two days, they would be in the sorcerer’s frozen realm. The atmosphere was covered in dark clouds and there was very little sunlight, during the night it was pitch black. Numerous streams flowed, originating from glaciers. There were long vines of thorns, the animals they saw were large carnivores that looked like mountain lions. There were mud footprints of plant-eaters who fed on the thorns. It was the morning of the fourth day, and as usual, it was very foggy. Not as foggy as the graveyard, but still foggy. At least this time they could see where they were going. “One more day.” Jasoner said to himself. Rinazor had taken wing to scout the route. They kept on going until Verderk held up his hand, he ran a distance to check something. He came back with excitement. ”There is a village ahead!” He announced. “What is a village doing all the way out here?” Jasoner asked. “I don’t know, but it doesn't look like a camp for the sorcerer's armies.” Verderk said excitedly. The three moved toward the village, when they got there, they can see it was an army camp, but not the sorcerer’s. “It is a rebel camp.” Verderk said. “Are they good guys or bad guys?” Trejakydon asked. “They are good guys. The sorcerer attacked them. These people are still fighting. We are both on the same side.” Jasoner answered. One of the rebels came over to them. “Verderk, we were beginning to worry about you.” He said. He was wearing red armor, he had a red helmet in one hand, and he had a bow and a quiver full of arrows on his back. At his side, was a four-foot long sword that had no sheath and was attached to the rebel’s belt, which also held the bow and quiver. The sword had a stone handle, and the blade was kind of rough and not very well made, and was fashioned of copper. “Apologies, Captain Willius, I was on a little crusade, and I got carried away, and raided more gold from the sorcerer’s vaults, then I first intended to. All my men were captured, I don’t know what has become of them now. What is your condition right now?” Verderk asked. “The sorcerer knows of our whereabouts. This base used to be top secret, but not anymore. Every night, we are attacked by two or more of the sorcerer’s giants.” Willius replied. “How many men do you have?” Verderk asked. “About five hundred, only two hundred can fight, the rest are injured. Spies report that the sorcerer is creating a new army just outside this camp’s borders.” Willius sat down at a table and looked at a map. “So far, this new army of his contains one thousand soldiers. About two giants, one hundred bat riders, eight hundred infantry from Trulor, and ninety-eight mounted clan cavalry from Trulor. More  are added to this every night. If we are attacked by this army, we won’t be able to hold and will be forced to withdraw.” He answered. “I found three additions to the rebel forces. Me again, Jasoner, and Trejakydon. Now we are ready to march on the sorcerer’s stronghold.” Verderk said. Willius laughed. “What?” He asked. “We can break through.” Verderk said. “You are not joking, are you?” Willius asked, Verderk sat down. “No, I am not. Trejakydon has the Vlfir Force, and Jasoner has a new wolf form.” He said. “Alright, I’ll take your word for it. However, before we march on the sorcerer, I have a quest for you, Trejakydon. There is a menace in a cave, His name is Trillidron, and he is a mercenary of the sorcerer. He is powerful, he may cause havoc if we march. Defeat him, and we will be able to attack the sorcerer’s stronghold.” Willius said.
