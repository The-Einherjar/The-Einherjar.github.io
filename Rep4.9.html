    <h1>Reptile Man IV: The Flames of Rorzron</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
    News was spreading fast, Zron’s forces were already in the city of Lynnwood and were making their way toward Lynnwood High at a fast pace. All the creatures in the school, including the ones from the other three schools were gathered. “Order!” Gost called. There was complete silence. “Thank you. As you know, the armies of Rorzron are almost here, and I mean, ALMOST here. You all know your positions and the battle plan. If you forgot your places, I’ll review them. Troy, Jill, and all the forces of Lynnwood High will be here in case this building comes under siege. Richard, you and the forces of Edmonds Woodway shall be spread out in the football fields outside to help defend the school. The fields are too small to hold all of you, so some of you will be in the next station, where Danny, and David, and Cody will be. They will be on the roads between the mall and the school for the illusion of the mirrors. The other forces there, will be Mountlake Terrace and Meadowdale. Jake, Brandon, Trevor, Ryan, the Inster forces, and I will be in Alderwood Mall to trap and severely weaken the Rorzron forces who come in.” Gost said. “Manfred, I want you to go at full speed to Rorzron and report back to me.” Gost said to the Skull Baron. “We’re fighting too!” Caleb said as he and the rest of the Gibbons came in. “You could use the extra numbers.” Mr. Gibbons said, drawing out the sword of Zat. 
    <p>It took fifteen minutes, but seemed like hours, everyone was in their position. A sound was heard, it sounded like millions of voices, the number of footsteps sounded was countless. Even Jake and the others who were in the mall heard it. Outside, Zorraiders flew to a building and landed, they looked at the school. The two Stouses who were riding with them jumped off the dragons and scanned the area. “Now!” Cody yelled out. His flying chariots unfolded the Multi Mirrors, and at that moment the creatures below them looked higher in number. “There are a lot of creatures guarding that place.” One of the Stouses said. “Thanks a lot, Captain Obvious!” One of the Zorraiders roared. “We can crush them all.” The second Stouse said. “Yes, but look, General Blind, that larger building over there provides a quicker route, let’s go through there.” The Zorraider said. “That’s the suggestion of a coward!” The Stouse complained. “Don’t question me, you insect in disguise. I’m in charge of this army, and I order that we go through that building first. Then, we attack that what they call a school.” The Zorraider commanded. There was ten seconds of silence. “Well...” The Zorraider said impatient. The Stouse took out a horn and blew it. The forces of Rorzron moved toward the mall. “It’s working!” Cody said. Thousands of arrows were fired at Zron’s forces, and catapults hurled stones. The army of Rorzron kept on moving toward Alderwood Mall.</p>
    <p>“They are coming!” Jake shouted as he withdrew from the window. “Here they come!” Trevor said as the war cries of the Shadowlings echoed. A catapult flew straight through the entrance, breaking the door. “Inoker, give the fire signal on my lead.” Jake said. The Shadowlings, Firelings, you name it, moved slowly into the mall. “Soon...” Ryan said quietly. Brandon, Jake, Gost, Trevor, and Ryan took hold of their talismans. More and more enemies poured into the mall. “Now!” Jake directed. Insters shot arrows and jumped with their swords drawn in front of the enemies. Jake and the other four turned into their talisman forms and started to attack the incoming enemies. One of the Shadowlings saw a large sword that was on the wall. It went and touched it, one hundred spears came flying out of the walls and each of them hit an enemy. The first trap had taken the enemies by surprise. After a few minutes of hand to hand combat, Gost ordered everyone in the mall to fall back to the middle section of the mall. Jake, Brandon, Trevor and Ryan stopped attacking with their weapons that were forged earlier, before the battle, Jake had a red sword, Trevor had a red spear , Brandon had a bow that  had tree bark on the wooden handle and had a quiver full of arrows, made of red diamond and Ryan, a red axe, they were fashioned from red diamond by Insters. They followed Gost, Zron’s forces pursued them, thinking they were retreating. However, this was part of the plan. They were actually leading the armies of Rorzron to more deadly traps that were about to get better and better as they went on.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile outside the mall, the Zorraider was growing impatient. “Order the rest to stop entering that building. The rest of us shall attack those other forces to get to the school. In the meantime, the others in that building will attack a different direction.” The Zorraider said. “Now we’re talking.” One of the Stouses said. It then blew another horn. The rest of Zron’s forces charged at the creatures Danny and Cody were commanding. “This is going to get ugly.” Cody said. Thousands of more arrows and more stones hit the enemies but they still charged. “Spears!” Cody shouted out. The creatures with spears pointed the barbs in front of them.</p>
    <p>All the Insters crossed bridges, Zron’s army was crossing. An Inster struck a chord with his sword, the bridges plummeted down a chasm. Then, big fire things with huge fire axes came from the ceiling. “The Fire.” Gost uttered. “Brandon shot his Arrow. The wood of the shaft burst into flame. Trevor shot an ice blast, it melted.</p>
    <p>A stone hit the school. “What was that?” Makaio asked. “It must have been a stone from a catapult. Zron’s forces seem to be breaking through our defenses.” Troy answered. Another stone hit the school.</p>
    <p>A trumpet sounded through the air. “The school is under attack.” Jake said. They stopped their attack and charged towards the exit.</p>
    <p>The Zorraider broke through the windows. “We meet again.” It said. “That fire lizard won’t save you now.” It added. Jill and Garry shot arrows, they bounced off the walking statue’s armor. “You cannot defeat me.” It said. Mr. Gibbons drew The Sword of Zat which glowed brightly in the dark presence of the Zorraider. Mr. Gibbons sliced at the Zorraider, or tried to anyway, it was blocked by the Zorraider’s axe, which broke in two pieces from the powerful energy from the legendary sword. “You are now unarmed!” Troy laughed. “Yes, I lost my axe, but you overlooked one thing, I am a Zorraider, I always have an extra weapon!” The Zorraider roared, drawing out a huge sword made out of stone. Mr. Gibbons and the Zorraider started to attack each other, therefore starting a swordfight. This fight lasted until the Zorraider heard a large amount of war cries. “Your forces are under attack, you better go help them.” Mr. Gibbons said. The Zorraider glared at them and jumped out the window and took off on his dragon. Caleb, Shealee, Mal,, and Brianna fired arrows at the dragon, who roared in pain.</p>
    <p>Outside the school was a great battle. “There is still a lot of enemies.” Trevor said. “Whenever I defeat one, another pops up in its place.” Brandon said. “Yeah, this is getting annoying.” Ryan said. “That is it, that is absolutely it!” Jake roared. The four  glowed and swirled around each other and light circled them causing pain to the Shadowlings, the light disappeared, and Osirisareses. They shot their potent attacks at Zron’s force. The remaining Zorraiders saw that their forces were losing and flew away, back to Rorzron. Everyone who was in the school came out to help finish off remaining enemies. The battle lasted a long time, with Osirisareses defeating large amounts of enemies at the same time, while everyone else was sword fighting, arrow shooting, or firing catapults or whatever. This indeed was one of the great battles in history. I can go on for hours describing the battle, but unfortunately I don’t have time to do that. Anyway, within about two hours, or something like that, the forces of Rorzron were defeated. “That is what I call a war.” Makaio said. Suddenly, Manfred landed in the middle of the battle field. “Defeated Zron’s first and minor army already, eh?” He  asked. “Minor?” Jake asked. Everyone looked surprised. “Let’s go inside there is some things must tell you.” The baron said.</p>
