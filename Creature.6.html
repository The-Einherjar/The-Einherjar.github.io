      <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
      Both Min Su and Zrisitis battled the rubber minions. Garry slashed another. One of the minions of Growlor was about to stab Min Su’s back, but Min Su quickly turned around and defended. The ice warrior fought one of Growlor’s minions, who was in the form of a tiger minotaur creature. The ice warrior tried to hit the minion with his branch, missed. The minion attacked back with his claw, the frozen armor protected the warrior. The minotaur leaped on top of Alderwood Mall. The ice warrior also leaped on top of the building, the minotaur struck with his horns, the warrior was sent flying  off the building, he got back up.
      <p>Meanwhile, Jake was fighting another minion, who was in the form of a reptile centaur.</p>
      <p>Ryan shot a fire stream at Tratwaq, the general leaped into the air. Tratwaq charged at Ryan, with his two maces, ready to attack.</p>
      <p>The ice warrior attacked again, and again, and again, The minotaur kept on evading. The warrior shot ice, but the minotaur moved out of the way, and camouflaged. The ice warrior listened. Suddenly, something struck his back. The ice warrior turned around, there was nothing there. Another blow struck his back. He turned around, but this time, he shot ice at the air. The minotaur turned visible again, hands frozen, the ice warrior then hit with the branch. The minotaur was sent flying off the building. The minotaur form disappeared. The ice warrior turned back into Trevor and Brandon.</p>
      <p>The centaur’s sword slashed at the charging Jake. Jake’s charge was redirected, and he crashed into a wall. He quickly got back up and fired a fire sphere. The centaur was propelled into a car, he flung the sword at Jake. Jake countered with  an energy shield. The centaur charged, Jake blocked the centaur’s claws with his. Jake shot a plasma blast, the centaur crashed into a car, and tumbled to the ground. He changed back. Jake transformed into his human form, and went to find out how the others were doing. Ryan was still battling with Tratwaq, and Drr was fighting Growlor.</p>
      <p>Growlor crashed into the mall. “I am getting tired of your insolence.” Growlor uttered, he charged with his claws. Drr shielded with his, Growlor changed back into his normal form, and fell to the ground. Drr walked near Growlor.</p>
