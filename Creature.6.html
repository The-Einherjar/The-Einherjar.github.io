  <h1>The Creature of Ancient Destruction</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
  Grutwaq stared down at his enemies. “We must defeat Grutwaq, united.” Min Su said. “All right then, this is likely to be our only chance at this. If we lose, we will probably be dead and he will start his evil regime, and we cannot allow that to happen can we?” Zrisitis asked. “Indeed, it would not be very nice if he won.” Garry replied. “Let’s not let him win then, shall we?” Osirisareses asked. Grutwaq laughed, his laugh echoed throughout the area. “You are all outrageous.” He sneered. ”If you think you can beat me then go ahead, be my guest and try!” He said. Zrisitis charged, he raised his spear and thrusted it downward, a gust of wind tore at Grutwaq like a sharp blade. Osrisareses shot a fireball, Min Su’s diamond fist glowed with fire and lightning energy, he punched Grutwaq. Garry fired an arrow. Grutwaq didn’t seem to be distressed by these attacks,  much, he looked disappointed as if he thought the battle was boring. Osirisareses shot a diamond energy blast, Grutwaq backed away a little, surprised by the power of the attack. Grutwaq picked up a truck and threw it at Min Su, who was protected by his diamond armor, but fell on his back, and had a truck on top of him. Zristis moved his spear like crazy, multiple gusts tore at Grutwaq. The rubber creature waved his hand and a purple energy wave discharged.  Drr, Zrisitis and Garry crashed into a restaurant across the road from the mall. Grutwaq then waved his hand, again and sent a purple energy wave toward Osirisareses. The great dragon generated a elemental shield to protect himself. Grutwaq shot a gigantic purple lightning bolt and destroyed Osirisareses’s shield, he shot another purple energy wave, and Osirisareses crashed next to Zrisitis. “That will teach you to interfere with my plans!” Grutwaq roared. Min Su began to charge up lightning and fire energy. Grutwaq walked towards Osirisareses. “Time to finish you, once and for all.” He uttered. Both his hands glowed with purple energy, he shot a purple stream at Osirisareses. Min Su shot energy towards the ground, the force propelled him into the air, he blocked Grutwaq’s attack. Min Su turned back into himself and fell to the ground. “Oh well. That takes care of you, at least.” Grutwaq said, looking down at Min Su. He shot another blast at  Osirisaress, who generated another elemental shield. Nonetheless, Grutwaq ‘s attack fractured it, and Osirisareses turned back into Ryan, Brandon, Trevor, and Jake. Grutwaq laughed in triumph.
Suddenly, Gost, Cyport and a gray reptile appeared. “Eh?” Grutwaq asked confused. Gost and the reptile quickly grabbed Drr, Ryan, Trevor, Min Su, Garry, Jake, Zrisitis, and Brandon and disappeared. “Alright then, I will just have to gather my minions and do this the hard way.” Grutwaq said. He flapped his giant wings and took off…
