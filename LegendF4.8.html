      <h1>The Legend of Four</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
     Jake, Paulius, Cristine, Paul, Jaclyn, and the principle were at an assembly. In the middle, a door opened. A tall figure in gold and red armor entered, five other characters followed. Three of them were the creatures that kidnapped Jacyln and Cristine. Then, another cloaked thing entered. Jake and Paul shot toward them. “I am General Reqror, I speak to you in negotiation.” The tall thing said. “What are these negotiations?” The principle asked. “You surrender the two girls.” General Reqror ordered. “No.” The principle responded. The cloaked figure threw off its hood, the cloak was black with red snake images. Its head was like a viper, except its eyes were red and the fangs showed outside. “I am Emperor Zror.” It roared. “I have come because I thought you should have a chance to join my side.” It said. “You are wasting your time.” A voice pronounced. It was Inoiker, an Inster. An Inster was like a red mantis except, it stood on two, and had two arms. It wielded an orange diamond sword. “Indeed.” Jake said, turning into a reptile, he had his sword, Paul turned into a dragon. The general drew a sword. “I’ll fight them.” Emperor Zror ordered. Jake grinned. Sure, Jasoner lost, but surely Jake and his Talisman, plus Paul and his talisman, and an Inster that lived and trained more years than Jake, Paul, and Zror, together, could together defeat this emperor, right? Zror drew out a sword, he charged at Inoiker. The Inster, Paul, and Jake attacked, Paul attacked with his long claw, Zror parried each. Again, and again they attacked, but Zror blocked. He blocked with such skill, it made the Inster cringe. “The sorcerer has taught you well, but not for this!” Jake said, shooting a blue fireball. The emperor slashed it away with his sword. “So, that’s how you want it, eh?” He laughed. “My turn!” He said, he shot an electric energy ball from his hand. Jake blocked with a blue energy barrier. Paul discharged his orange blast, Zror looked as if he was engulfed in orange energy, but he waved his fingers, the orange energy move into a ball in front of Paul and shot at the dragon. Paul dropped to the ground. “Pathetic.” He said. “Time is now.” He, his general, and agents exited.
     <p>“They went toward a forest near Alderwood.” Jake said. “They aren’t coming by the portal in the cave.” Jasoner uttered. “There is another, I came by that. I didn’t expect them to use it.” He added. “Where are our forces?” Jake asked. “They are going to the field.” Inoiker said. “Turn them.” Cody directed.</p>
