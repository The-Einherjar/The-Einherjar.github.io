      <h1>Reptile Man III: Dawn of the Talismans</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
      Jake woke up, it was hot, a little too hot. He then remembered everything that happened and got up. He was in a cavern, underground. “You’ve come to?” Somebody said. It was a youth about seventeen years old, he wore a thick coat, and carried a sword. Two others came, one looked to be sixteen, the other fourteen. The sixteen-year-old had an axe, and the fourteen-year-old had a spear with two sharp ends. “We found you in the smoke, and got you to this cave.” The seventeen-year-old said. “Thanks.” Jake said. “Where did you come from?” The sixteen-year-old asked. “I came from Lynnwood, I ended up here by falling from the volcano.” Jake answered. “Who are you?” The seventeen-year-old asked. “My name is Jake.” Jake replied. “My name is Tim. Those are my brothers, Frank and Pete. We are warriors, our trade being, to travel from place to place, defending the peoples down here.” The seventeen-year-old said. “How do I get to the surface?” Jake asked. “We are two kilometers from the ground. The caverns that travel there are on the side road.” Pete said.
      <p>Ino, Garry Ryan, Trevor, and Brandon were in the air. Behind them were Brian and Alex, who were late for the party. The icy peak of Mount Baker was taking shape in the horizon.</p>
      <p>“Finally, the time has arrived.” Inoik said as the robot put the rock with ancient text in the middle of the room with lava circling it, the Wall of Rorzron. At this moment, Ino, Garry Ryan, Trevor, and Brandon landed on top of the peak above the crater. Inoik fired a torch, and lighted the wall, he then started to chant the ancient writings written on the wall. Ryan, and the rest secretly entered the room and hid behind the rocks in the far corner. The stone started to glow, Inoik chanted louder and faster. The wall glowed,  the stone broke into hundreds of pieces. In its place, was a creature, a creature that was quite familiar. “Grutwaq.” Garry said. The creature was indeed Grutwaq, but this one looked different. This time, Grutwaq was tall, twelve feet high. He had two spikes on each of his shoulders, he had razor sharp claws, he also had a long tail with a poisonous stinger at the end of it. He had two wings, tail like things attached to his back, he had a stinger on one of them, with a hard club like thing on another, an axe shaped spike on the third, and a mouth with cobra fangs on the fourth. “I have returned.” It laughed. “Lord Grutwaq, I am the one who released you.” Inoik said. “Yes, I remember our bargain. Your reward, domination of the world will be delivered soon.” Grutwaq started, but began to sniff. “I smell something nearby.” He said. Garry knocked an arrow, and aimed. Grutwaq turned, Garry jumped out of the shadows, and shot. The arrow did not do much. Gost laughed. “How brave of you. Have your allies abandoned you?” He asked. Ino jumped out, and then Brandon, Trevor and Ryan, who activated their talismans. Ryan, whose talisman for was ten feet tall, took on Grutwaq by himself. Inoik turned to the others, and waved his claw, a diamond appeared in the air and broke into shards. It rained down on Trevor and Brandon. He then shot a lightning bolt into the air which turned into dark stones, and dropped and covered Garry. Inoik then turned to Ino. “Now, deal with you myself.” He said. Ryan punched Grutwaq with his flame fist, which did very little. Grutwaq slashed at Ryan with his axe tail. Ryan flew up into the air and shot a fire ball. “Fire cracker? Is that all you got?” Grutwaq laughed. Ryan unleashed fiery hands from his wings, this barley did anything to the rubber creature. “My turn now!” Grutwaq declared as he shot a blast of purple energy. Ryan generated a shield similar to Jake’s plasma version, except this was made out of fire. However, this did not stop the fury of Grutwaq’s blast, which broke the shield and struck Ryan with force, knocking him to the ground. Grutwaq stood over him with his tail with the stinger raised. “I have won!” He announced. Before he was able to deliver the finishing blow, a quick shock of energy zapped through him. “Huh?” He said, he turned and came face to face with Garry. “I remember you, you were the one I imprisoned.” Grutwaq said. “You were not able to defeat me last time, and this fire dragon of yours wasn’t able to stop me, what makes you think you can now?” Grutwaq asked. Garry did not answer, instead he shot another laser arrow, which did nothing to the rubber fiend. Grutwaq’s hand glowed, and a strange jar appeared on it, it was the very same jar Grutwaq used to trap Garry the last time they met. “I’ll do what I should have done a long time ago, then I’ll finish off this puny attack force of yours, then I’ll finish my revenge.” He said. “I think not.” Trevor said as he entered the scene. “Ah, another creature, eh?” Grutwaq mocked. Trevor shot a large stream of white energy, it froze Grutwaq. “That was easy.” Trevor said. Grutwaq broke out of the frost. “Impressive, you won’t be as easy as I expected.” He said, he tried to hit Trevor with his axe tail, but missed. Trevor’s horn glowed and shot a blizzard. Grutwaq was hit multiple times by sharp icicles. “Ah! Grutwaq shouted. He shot an energy ball and knocked Trevor unconscious. Brandon shot a solar blast, the force knocked Grutwaq to the ground but, he jumped back up. Grutwaq shot more energy bolts, Brandon’s horn glowed and absorbed the energy, it was painful, but he was able to absorb it. He then fired it back at Grutwaq. “No!” Grutwaq cried as the energy hit him. Grutwaq was on the ground but jumped back up again. “Absorb this!” He said as he leaped at Brandon and started to attack him with his axe tail. “Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Get of me!” Brandon roared, he shot his solar blast at full power. “You shall not win!” Grutwaq roared back, firing his own blast. When the two blasts hit each other it caused an explosion. When the smoke cleared Brandon was on the ground beaten, while Grutwaq was up breathing hard. “He...He...He didn't...“ He uttered, he laughed.Ino was fighting Inoik, when he saw what happened he broke away from his opponent and leaped at Grutwaq with both claws raised. Grutwaq punched him, Ino fell to the ground beaten. “Now, it is time to finish this.” Grutwaq said. Alex, and Brian came down crashed into Grutwaq. “It’s you!” Grutwaq roared angrily. “Hey, aren’t you the guy who was trapped in a rock that was in this crater?” Brian asked. “Yes, it is me. I’m back! And I want revenge now! You, and that green lizard thing were the ones that helped the Gibbon's trap me!” Grutwaq roared. “I see you haven’t changed one bit.”  Alex said. “I shall destroy you and that reptile thing wherever it is then I will trap the Gibbons's into eternal imprisonment, just as they did me twice in two and a half millenniums!” Grutwaq yelled. “You definitely did not change one bit.” Brian said. “I think we should get out of here.” Garry said. “I agree, that is why I brought a little something.” Alex said. Something drove to the crater. It was Mr. Gibbons, and his truck Brian, Alex, and Garry got everyone including Ryan, Trevor, and Brandon who were in their original forms, into the back of the pickup. They then themselves got in, and Mr. Gibbons drove off at maximum speed. “Don’t think you can run from me, I know where all of you live, I seen your domain before, and I will come for you sooner than you think.” Grutwaq said. “Grutwaq, should we do anything?” Gost asked. “Yes, turn this place into a proper base. I am going to summon my minions.” Grutwaq said.</p>
